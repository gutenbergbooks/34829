<h2>THE SICK-A-BED LADY</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="162" height="164" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE Sick-A-Bed Lady lived in a
huge old-fashioned mahogany bedstead,
with solid silk sheets, and
three great squashy silk pillows
edged with fluffy ruffles. On a
table beside the Sick-A-Bed Lady
was a tiny little, shiny little bell that tinkled exactly
like silver raindrops on a golden roof, and all
around this Lady and this Bedstead and this Bell
was a big, square, shadowy room with a smutty
fireplace, four small paned windows, and a chintzy
wall-paper showered profusely with high-handled
baskets of lavender flowers over which strange
green birds hovered languidly.</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Sick-A-Bed Lady, herself, was as old as
twenty, but she did not look more than fifteen with
her little wistful white face against the creamy pillows
and her soft brown hair braided in two thick
pigtails and tied with great pink bows behind each
ear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Sick-A-Bed Lady felt like sitting up
high against her pillows, she could look out across
the footboard through her opposite window. Now
through that opposite window was a marvelous vista&mdash;an
old-fashioned garden, millions of miles of
ocean, and then&mdash;France! And when the wind
was in just the right direction there was a perfectly
wonderful smell to be smelled&mdash;part of it was Cinnamon
Pink and part of it was Salt-Sea-Weed, but
most of it, of course, was&mdash;France. There were
days and days, too, when any one with sense could
feel that the waves beat perkily against the shore
with a very strong French accent, and that all one's
French verbs, particularly "<i>J'aime</i>, <i>Tu aimes</i>, <i>Il
aime</i>," were coming home to rest. What else was
there to think about in bed but funny things like
that?</p>

<p>It was the Old Doctor who had brought the Sick-A-Bed
Lady to the big white house at the edge of
the Ocean, and placed her in the cool, quaint room
with its front windows quizzing dreamily out to sea,
and its side windows cuddled close to the curving
village street. It was a long, tiresome, dangerous
journey, and the Sick-A-Bed Lady in feverish fancy
had moaned: "I shall die, I shall die, I shall <i>die</i>,"
every step of the way, but, after all, it was the Old
Doctor who did the dying! Just like a snap of the
finger he went at the end of two weeks, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Sick-A-Bed Lady rallied to the shock with a plaintive:
"Seems to me he was in an <i>awful</i> hurry,"
and fell back on her soft bed into days of unconsciousness
that were broken only by riotous visions
day and night of an old man rushing frantically up
to a great white throne yelling: "One, two, three,
for Myself!"</p>

<p>Out of this trouble the Sick-A-Bed Lady woke
one day to find herself quite alone and quite alive.
She had often felt alone before, but it was a long
time since she had felt alive. The world seemed
very pleasant. The flowers on the wall-paper were
still unwilted, and the green paper birds hung airily
without fatigue. The room was full of the most
enticing odor of cinnamon pinks, and by raising herself
up in bed the merest trifle she could get a smell
of good salt, a smell which somehow you couldn't
get unless you actually <i>saw</i> the Ocean, but just as
she was laboriously tugging herself up an atom
higher, trying to find the teeniest, weeniest sniff of
France, everything went suddenly black and silver
before her eyes, and she fell down, down, down,
as much as forty miles into Nothing At All.</p>

<p>When she woke up again all limp and wappsy
there was a Young Man's Face on the Footboard
of the bed; just an isolated, unconnected sort of
face that might have blossomed from the footboard,
or might have been merely a mirage on the horizon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Whatever it was, though, it kept staring at her fixedly,
balancing itself all the while most perfectly
on its chin. It was a funny sight, and while the
Sick-A-Bed Lady was puckering her forehead trying
to think out what it all meant the Young Man's
Face smiled at her and said "<i>Boo!</i>" and the Sick-A-Bed Lady
tiptilted her chin weakly and said&mdash;"Boo
<i>yourself!</i>" Then the Sick-A-Bed Lady
fell into her fearful stupor again, and the Young
Man's Face ran home as fast as it could to
tell its Best Friend that the Sick-A-Bed Lady had
spoken her first sane word for five weeks. He
thought it was a splendid victory, but when he tried
to explain it to his friend, he found that "Boo
<i>yourself!</i>" seemed a fatuous proof of so startling
a truth, and was obliged to compromise with considerable
dignity on the statement: "Well, of
course, it wasn't so much what she said as the <i>way</i>
she said it."</p>

<p>For days and days that followed, the Sick-A-Bed
Lady was conscious of nothing except the Young
Man's Face on the footboard of the bed. It never
seemed to wabble, it never seemed to waver, but just
stayed there perfectly balanced on the point of its
chin, watching her gravely with its blue, blue eyes.
There was a cleft in its chin, too, that you could
have stroked with your finger if&mdash;you could have.
Of course, there were some times when she went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
sleep, and some times when she just seemed to go
<i>out</i> like a candle, but whenever she came back from
<i>anything</i> there was always the Young Man's Face
for comfort.</p>

<p>The Sick-A-Bed Lady was so sick that she
thought all over her body instead of in her head,
so that it was very hard to concentrate any particular
thought in her mouth, but at last one afternoon
with a mighty struggle she opened her half-closed
eyes, looked right in the Young Man's Face and
said: "Got any arms?"</p>

<p>The Young Man's Face nodded perfectly politely,
and smiled as he raised two strong, lean hands to
the edge of the footboard, and hunched his shoulders
obligingly across the sky line.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" he asked very gently.</p>

<p>Then the Sick-A-Bed Lady knew at once that it
was the Young Doctor, and wondered why she
hadn't thought of it before.</p>

<p>"Am I pretty sick?" she whispered deferentially.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I think you are <i>very pretty</i>&mdash;sick," said
the Young Doctor, and he towered up to a terrible,
leggy height and laughed joyously, though there was
almost no sound to his laugh. Then he went over
to the window and began to jingle small bottles, and
the Sick-A-Bed Lady lay and watched him furtively
and thought about his compliment, and wondered
why when she wanted to smile and say "Thank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
you" her mouth should shut tight and her left foot
wiggle, instead.</p>

<p>When the Young Doctor had finished jingling
bottles, he came and sat down beside her and fed her
something wet out of a cool spoon, which she swallowed
and swallowed and swallowed, feeling all the
while like a very sick brown-eyed dog that couldn't
wag anything but the far-away tip of its tail. When
she got through swallowing she wanted very much
to stand up and make a low bow, but instead she
touched the warm little end of her tongue to the
Young Doctor's hand. After that, though, for
quite a few minutes her brain felt clean and tidy,
and she talked quite pleasantly to the Young Doctor:
"Have you got any bones in your arms?" she
asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, indeed," said the Young Doctor,
"rather more than the usual number of bones.
Why?"</p>

<p>"I'd give my life," said the Sick-A-Bed Lady,
"if there were bones in my silky pillows." She
faltered a moment and then continued bravely:
"Would you mind&mdash;holding me up stiff and strong
for a second? There's no bottom to my bed,
there's no top to my brain, and if I can't find a hard
edge to something I shall topple right off the earth.
So would you mind holding me like an <i>edge</i> for a
moment&mdash;that is&mdash;if there's no lady to care?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I'm not a little girl," she added conscientiously&mdash;"I'm
twenty years old."</p>

<p>So the Young Doctor slipped over gently behind
her and lifted her limp form up into the lean, solid
curve of his arm and shoulder. It wasn't exactly
a sumptuous corner like silken pillows, but it felt as
glad as the first rock you strike on a life-swim for
shore, and the Sick-A-Bed Lady dropped right off
to sleep sitting bolt upright, wondering vaguely how
she happened to have two hearts, one that fluttered
in the usual place, and one that pounded rather
noisily in her back somewhere between her shoulder-blades.</p>

<p>On his way home that day the Young Doctor
stopped for a long while at his Best Friend's house
to discuss some curious features of the Case.</p>

<p>"Anything new turned up?" asked the Best
Friend.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the Young Doctor, pulling moodily
at his cigar.</p>

<p>"Well, it certainly beats <i>me</i>," exclaimed the Best
Friend, "how any long-headed, shrewd old fellow
like the Old Doctor could have brought a raving
fever patient here and installed her in his own house
under that clumsy Old Housekeeper without once
mentioning to any one who the girl was, or where
to communicate with her people. Great Heavens,
the Old Doctor knew what a poor 'risk' he was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
He knew absolutely that that heart of his would
burst some day like a firecracker."</p>

<p>"The Old Doctor never was very communicative,"
mused the Young Doctor, with a slight
grimace that might have suggested professional
memories not strictly pleasant. "But I'll surely
never forget him as long as ether exists," he added
whimsically. "Why, you'd have thought the old
chap invented ether&mdash;you'd have thought he ate it,
drank it, bathed in it. I hope the <i>smell</i> of my profession
will never be the only part of it I'm willing
to share."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the Best Friend, "that's
all right. If he wanted to go off every Winter to
the States and work in the Hospitals, and come back
every Spring smelling like a Surgical Ward, with a
lot of wonderful information which he kept to himself,
why, that was his own business. He was a
plucky old fellow anyway to go at all. But what
I'm kicking at is his wicked carelessness in bringing
this young girl here in a critical illness without
taking a single soul into his confidence. Here he's
dead and buried for weeks, and the Girl's people are
probably worrying themselves crazy about not hearing
from her. But why don't they write? Why in
thunder don't they write?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me!" cried the Young Doctor nervously.
"I don't know! I don't know anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
about it. Why, I don't even know whether the
Girl is going to live. I don't even know whether
she'll ever be sane again. How can I stop to quiz
about her name and her home, when, perhaps, her
whole life and reason rests in my foolish hands that
have never done anything yet much more vital than
usher a perfectly willing baby into life, or tinker
with croup in some chunky throat? There's only
one thing in the case that I'm sure of, and that is
that she doesn't know herself who she is, and the
effort to remember might snap her utterly. She's
just a thread.</p>

<p>"I have an idea&mdash;" the Young Doctor shook his
shoulders as though to shake off his more somber
thoughts&mdash;"I have an idea that the Old Doctor
rather counted on building up a sort of informal
sanitarium here. He was daft, you know, about
the climate on this particular stretch of coast. You
remember that he brought home some athlete last
Summer&mdash;pretty bad case of breakdown, too, but
the Old Doctor cured him like a magician; and the
Spring before that there was a little lad with epilepsy,
wasn't there? The Old Doctor let me look
at him once just to tease me. And before that&mdash;I
can count up half-a-dozen people of that sort, people
whom you would have said were 'gone-ers,' too.
Oh, the Old Doctor would have brought home a
dead man to cure if any one had 'stumped' him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
And I guess this present case was a 'stump' fast
enough. Why, she was raging like a prairie fire
when they brought her here. No other man would
have dared to travel. And they put her down in a
great silk bed like a fairy-story, and the Old Doctor
sat and watched her night and day studying her
like a fiend, and she got better after a while: not
keen, you know, but funny like a child, cooing and
crooning over her pretty room, and tickled to pieces
with the ocean, and vain as a kitten over her pink
ribbons&mdash;the Old Doctor wouldn't let them cut
her hair&mdash;and everything went on like that, till in
a horrid flash the Old Doctor dropped dead that
morning at the breakfast table, the little girl went
loony again, and every possible clew to her identity
was wiped off the earth!"</p>

<p>"No baggage?" suggested the Best Friend.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, there was baggage!" the
Young Doctor exclaimed, "a great trunk. Haven't
the Housekeeper and I rummaged and rummaged it
till I can feel the tickle of lace across my wrists even
in my sleep? Why, man alive! she's a <i>rich</i> girl.
There never were such clothes in our town before.
She's no free hospital pauper whom the Old Doctor
obligingly took off their hands. That is, I don't
see how she can be!</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he continued bitterly, "everybody in
town calls her just the Sick-A-Bed Lady, and pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
soon it will be the Death-Bed Lady, and then it will
be the Dead-and-Buried Lady&mdash;and that's all we'll
ever know about it." He shivered clammily as he
finished and reached for a scorching glass of whisky
on the table.</p>

<p>But the Young Doctor did not feel so lugubrious
the next day and the next and the next, when he
found the Sick-A-Bed Lady rallying slowly but
surely to the skill of his head and hands. To be
frank, she still lay for hours at a time in a sort of
gentle daze watching the world go by without her,
but little by little her body strengthened as a wilted
flower freshens in water, and little by little she
struggled harder for words that even then did not
always match her thoughts.</p>

<p>The village continued to speculate about her lost
identity, but the Young Doctor seemed to worry
less and less about it as time went on. If the sweetest
little girl you ever saw knew perfectly whom
you meant when you said "Dear," what was the use
of hunting up such prosy names as May or Alice?
And as to her funny speeches, was there anything
in the world more piquant than to be called a
"beautiful horse," when she meant a "kind doctor"?
Was there anything dearer than her absurd
wrath over her blunders, or the way she shook her
head like an angry little heifer, when she occasionally
forgot altogether how to talk? It was at one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of these latter times that the Young Doctor, watching
her desperate struggle to focus her speech, forgot
all about her twenty years and stooped down
suddenly and kissed her square on her mouth.</p>

<p>"There," he laughed, "<i>that</i> will help you remember
where your mouth is!" But it was astonishing
after that how many times he had to remind her.</p>

<p>He couldn't help loving her. No man could
have helped loving her. She was so little and dear
and gentle and&mdash;lost.</p>

<p>The Sick-A-Bed Lady herself didn't know who
she was, but she would have perished with fright if
she had realized that no one in the village, and not
even the Young Doctor himself, could guess her
identity.</p>

<p>The Young Doctor knew everything else in the
world; why shouldn't he know who she was? He
knew all about France being directly opposite the
house; he had known it ever since he was a boy, and
had been glad about it. He stopped her trying to
count the green birds on the wall-paper because he
"knew positively" that there were four hundred
and seventeen whole birds, and nineteen half birds
cut off by the wainscoting. He never laughed at
her when she slid down the side of her bed by the
village street window, and went to sleep with her
curly head pillowed on the hard, white sill. He
never laughed, because he understood perfectly that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
if you hung one white arm down over the sidewalk
when you went to sleep, sometimes little children
would come and put flowers in your hand, or, more
wonderful still, perhaps, a yellow collie dog would
come and lick your fingers.</p>

<p>Nothing could surprise the Young Doctor.
Sometimes the Sick-A-Bed Lady took thoughts she
did have and mixed them up with thoughts she
didn't have, and <i>sprung</i> them on the poor Young
Doctor, but he always said, "Why, of <i>course</i>," as
simply as possible.</p>

<p>But more than all the other wise things he knew
was the wise one about smelly things. He knew
that when you were very, very, <i>very</i> sick, nothing
pleased you so much as nice, smelly things. He
brought wild strawberries, for instance, not so much
to eat as to smell, but when he wasn't looking she
gobbled them down as fast as she could. And he
brought her all kinds of flowers, one or two at a
time, and seemed so disappointed when she just
sniffed them and smiled; but one day he brought her
a spray of yellow jasmine, and she snatched it up
and kissed it and cried "<i>Home</i>," and the Young Doctor
was so pleased that he wrote it right down in a
little book and ran away to study up something.
He let her smell the fresh green bank-notes in his
pocketbook. Oh, they were good to smell, and
after a while she said "Shops." He brought her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a tiny phial of gasoline from his neighbor's automobile,
and she crinkled up her nose in disgust and
called it "gloves" and slapped it playfully out of
his hand. But when he brought her his riding-coat
she rubbed her cheek against it and whispered some
funny chirruppy things. His pipe, though, was the
most confusing symbol of all. It was his best pipe,
too, and she snuggled it up to her nose and cried
"<i>You, y-o-u!</i>" and hid it under her pillow and
wouldn't give it back to him, and though he tried
her a dozen times about it, she never acknowledged
any association except that joyous, "<i>Y-o-u!</i>"</p>

<p>So day by day she gained in consecutive thought
till at last she grew so reasonable as to ask: "Why
do you call me <i>Dear?</i>"</p>

<p>And the Young Doctor forgot all about his earliest
reason and answered perfectly simply: "Because
I love you."</p>

<p>Then some of the evenings grew to be almost
sweetheart evenings, though the Sick-A-Bed Lady's
fragile childishness keyed the Young Doctor into an
almost uncanny tenderness and restraint.</p>

<p>Those were wonderful evenings, though, after the
Sick-A-Bed Lady began to get better and better.
A good deal of the Young Doctor's practice was
scattered up and down the coast, and after the dust
and sweat and glare and rumble of his long day he
would come back to the sleepy village in the early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
evening, plunge for a freshening swim into the salt
water, don his white clothes and saunter round to
the quaint old house at the edge of the ocean. Here
in the breezy kitchen he often sat for as long as an
hour, talking with the Old Housekeeper, till the
Sick-A-Bed Lady's tiny silver bell rang out with
absurd peremptoriness. Then for as much time as
seemed wise he went and sat with the Sick-A-Bed
Lady.</p>

<p>One night, one full-moon night, he came back
from his day's work extraordinarily tired and fretted
after a series of strident experiences, and hurried
to the old house as to a veritable Haven of
Refuge. The Housekeeper was busy with village
company, so he postponed her report and went at
once to the Sick-A-Bed Lady's room.</p>

<p>Only fools lit lights on such a night as that, and
he threw himself down in the big chair by the bedside,
and fairly basked in peacefulness and moonlight
and content, while the Sick-A-Bed Lady leaned
over and stroked his hair with her little white fingers,
crooning some pleasant, childish thing about
"nice, smoky Boy." There was no fret or fuss
or even sound in the room, except the drowsy murmur
of voices in the Garden, and the churky splash
of little waves against the shore.</p>

<p>"Hear the French Verbs," said the Sick-A-Bed
Lady, at last, with deliberate mischief. Then she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
shut her lips tight and waved her hands distractedly
after a manner she had when she wished to imply
that she was suddenly stricken dumb. The Young
Doctor laughed and reached over and kissed her.</p>

<p>"<i>J'aime</i>," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>J'aime</i>," the Sick-A-Bed Lady repeated.</p>

<p>"<i>Tu aimes</i>," he persisted.</p>

<p>"<i>Tu aimes</i>," she echoed on his lips.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then&mdash;"There'll be no '<i>he</i> loves' to our
story," he cried suddenly, and caught her so fiercely
to his breast that she gave a little quick gasp of pain
and struggled back on her pillows, and the Young
Doctor jumped up in bitter, stinging contrition and
strode out of the room. Just across the threshold
he met the Old Housekeeper with a clattering tray
of dishes.</p>

<p>"I'm going down to the Library to smoke," he
said huskily to her. "Come there when you've
finished. I want to talk with you."</p>

<p>His thoughts of himself were not kind as he wandered
into the library and settled down in the first
big chair that struck his fancy.</p>

<p>Then he fell to wondering whether there was anything
gross about his love, because it took no heed
of mental qualifications. He thought of at least
three houses in the village where that very night he
would have found lights and laughter and clever
talk, and the prodding sympathy of earnest women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
who made the sternest happening of the day seem
nothing more than a dress rehearsal for the evening's
narration of it. Then he thought again of
the big, quiet room upstairs, with its unquestioning
peace and love and restfulness and content. What
was the best thing after all that a woman could
bring to a man? Yet a year ago he had bragged of
the blatant braininess of his best woman friend!
He began to laugh at himself.</p>

<p>Slowly the incongruities of the whole situation
bore in upon him, and he sat and smoked and smiled
in moody silence, staring with skeptical interest at
the dimly lighted room around him. It was certainly
the Old Doctor's private study, and realization
of just what that meant came over him ironically.</p>

<p>The Old Doctor had been very stingy with his
house and his books and his knowledge and his patients.
It was natural perhaps under the professional
circumstances of waning Age and waxing
Youth. Yet the fact remained. Never before in
five years of village association had the Young Doctor
crossed the threshold of the Old Doctor's home,
yet now he came and went like the Man of the
House. Here he sat at this instant in the Old Doctor's
private study, in the Old Doctor's chair, his
feet upon the Old Doctor's table, and the whole
great room with its tier after tier of bookcases, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
its drawer after drawer of probable memoranda
<i>free</i> before him. He could imagine the Old Doctor's
impotent wrath over such a contingency, yet
he felt no sentimental mawkishness over his own
position. As far as he knew the Dead were dead.</p>

<p>Sitting there in the Old Doctor's study, he conjured
up scene after scene of the Old Doctor's irascibility
and exclusiveness. Even as late as the Sick-A-Bed
Lady's arrival, the Old Doctor had snubbed
him unmercifully before a crowd of people. It was
at the station when the little sick stranger was being
taken off the car and put into a carriage, and the
Old Doctor had hailed the Younger with unwonted
friendliness.</p>

<p>"I've got a case in there that would make you
famous if you could master it," he said.</p>

<p>The Young Doctor remembered perfectly how he
had walked into the trap.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he had cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"That's none of your business," chuckled the
Old Doctor, and drove away with all the platform
loafers shouting with delight.</p>

<p>Well, it seemed to be the Young Doctor's business
<i>now</i>, and he got up, turned the lamp higher and began
to hunt through the Old Doctor's rarest books
for some light on certain curious developments in
the Sick-A-Bed Lady's case.</p>

<p>He was just in the midst of this hunt when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Old Housekeeper glided in like a ghost and startled
him.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said absent-mindedly, and went
on with his reading. He had almost forgotten her
presence when she coughed and said: "Excuse me,
sir, but I've something very special to say to you."</p>

<p>The Young Doctor looked up in surprise and saw
that the Woman's face was ashy white.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;think&mdash;you quite&mdash;understand
the case," she stammered. "I think the little lady
upstairs is going to be a Mother!"</p>

<p>The Young Doctor put his hand up to his face,
and his face felt like parchment. He put his hand
down to the book again, and the book cover quivered
like flesh.</p>

<p>"What do you m-e-a-n?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I mean," said the Old Housekeeper,
and led him back to the sick room.</p>

<p>Two hours later the Young Doctor staggered into
his Best Friend's house clutching a sheet of letter
paper in his hand. His shoulders dragged as though
under a pack, and every trace of boyishness was
wrung like a rag out of his face.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, what's the matter?" cried
his friend, starting up.</p>

<p>"Nothing," muttered the Young Doctor, "except
the Sick-A-Bed Lady."</p>

<p>"When did she die? What happened?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The Young Doctor made a gesture of dissent and
crawled into a chair and began to fumble with the
paper in his hand. Then he shivered and stared his
Best Friend straight in the face.</p>

<p>"You might say," he stammered, "that I have
just heard from the Sick-A-Bed Lady's Husband&mdash;"
he choked at the word, and his Friend sat
up with astonishment: "You heard me <i>say</i> I had
heard from the Sick-A-Bed Lady's Husband?" he
persisted. "<i>You</i> heard me say it, mind you. You
heard me say that her Husband is sick in Japan&mdash;detained
indefinitely&mdash;so we are afraid he won't
get here in time for her confinement&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sweat broke out in great drops on his forehead,
and his hand that held the sheet of paper
shook like a hand that has strained its muscles with
heavy weights.</p>

<p>The Best Friend took a scathing glance at the
scribbled words on the paper and laughed mirthlessly.</p>

<p>"You're a good fool," he said, "a good fool,
and I'll publish your blessed lie to the whole stupid
village, if that's what you want."</p>

<p>But the Young Doctor sat oblivious with his head
in his hands, muttering: "Blind fool, blind fool,
how could I have been such a blind fool?"</p>

<p>"What is it to <i>you?</i>" asked his Best Friend abruptly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The Young Doctor jumped to his feet and squared
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's <i>this</i> to me," he cried, "that I wanted her
for my own! I could have cured her. I tell you
I could have cured her. I wanted her for my
own!"</p>

<p>"She's only a waif," said the Best Friend
tersely.</p>

<p>"Waif?" cried the Young Doctor, "<i>waif?</i> No
woman whom I love is a <i>waif!</i>" His face blazed
furiously. "The woman I <i>love</i>&mdash;that little gentle
girl&mdash;a waif?&mdash;without a home?&mdash;I would
make a cool home for her out of Hell itself, if it
was necessary! Damn, damn, <i>damn</i> the brute that
deserted her, but <i>home is all around her</i> <span class="smcap">now</span>! Do
I think the Old Doctor guessed about it? <i>N-o!</i>
Nobody could have guessed about it. Nobody could
have known about it much before this. You say
<i>again</i> she isn't <i>anybody's?</i> I'll prove to you as
soon as it's decent that she's <i>mine</i>."</p>

<p>His Best Friend took him by the shoulder and
shook him roughly.</p>

<p>"It is no time," he said, "for you to be courting
a woman."</p>

<p>"I'll court my Sweetheart when and where I
choose!" the Young Doctor answered defiantly, and
left the house.</p>

<p>The night seemed a thousand miles long to him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but when he slept at last and woke again, the air
was fresh and hopeful with a new day. He dressed
quickly and hurried off to the scene of last night's
tragedy, where he found the Old Housekeeper arguing
in the doorway with a small boy. She turned to
the Doctor complacently. "He's begging for the
postage stamp off the Japanese letter," she exclaimed,
"and I'm just telling him I sent it to my
Sister's boy in Montreal."</p>

<p>There was no slightest trace of self-consciousness
in her manner, and the Young Doctor could not
help but smile as he beckoned her into the house and
shut the door.</p>

<p>Then, "Have you told her?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>The Old Housekeeper humped her shoulders
against the door and folded her arms sumptuously.
"No, I haven't told her," she said, "and I'm not
going to. I don't dar'st! I help you out about
your business same as I helped the Old Doctor out
about his business. That's all right. That's as it
should be. And I'll go skipping up those stairs to
tell the little lady any highfaluting, pleasant yarn
that you can invent, but I don't budge one single
step to tell that poor, innocent, loony Lamb&mdash;the
<i>truth</i>. It isn't ugliness, Doctor. I haven't got the
strength, that's all!"</p>

<p>Just then the little silver bell tinkled, and the Doctor
went heavily up the few steps that swung the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Sick-A-Bed Lady's room just out of line of real upstairs
or downstairs.</p>

<p>The Sick-A-Bed Lady was lying in glorious state,
arrayed in a wonderful pale green kimono with
shimmering silver birds on it.</p>

<p>"You stayed too long downstairs," she asserted
and went on trying to cut out pictures from a magazine.</p>

<p>The Young Doctor stood at the window looking
out to sea as long as his legs would hold him, and
then he came back and sat down on the edge of the
bed.</p>

<p>"What's your name, Honey?" he asked with a
forced smile.</p>

<p>"Why, 'Dear,' of course," she answered and
dropped her scissors in surprise.</p>

<p>"What's my name?" he continued, fencing for
time.</p>

<p>"Just '<i>Boy</i>,'" she said with sweet, contented positiveness.</p>

<p>The Young Doctor shivered and got up and
started to leave the room, but at the threshold he
stopped resolutely and came back and sat down
again.</p>

<p>This time he took his Mother's wedding ring from
his little finger and twirled it with apparent aimlessness
in his hands.</p>

<p>Its glint caught the Sick-A-Bed Lady's eye, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
she took it daintily in her fingers and examined it
carefully. Then, as though it recalled some vague
memory, she crinkled up her forehead and started
to get out of bed. The Young Doctor watched her
with agonized interest. She went direct to her bureau
and began to search diligently through all the
drawers, but when she reached the lower drawer
and found some bright-colored ribbons she forgot
her original quest, whatever it was, and brought all
the ribbons back to bed with her.</p>

<p>The Young Doctor started to leave her again, this
time with a little gesture which she took to be anger,
but he had not gone further than the head of the
stairs before she called him back in a voice that was
startlingly mature and reasonable.</p>

<p>"Oh, Boy, come back," she cried. "I'll be good.
What do you want?"</p>

<p>The Young Doctor came doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Do you understand me to-day?" he asked in a
voice that sent an ominous chill to her heart. "Can
you think pretty clearly to-day?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head. "Yes," she answered;
"it's a good day."</p>

<p>"Do you know what marriage is?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, but her face clouded perceptibly.</p>

<p>Then he took her in his arms and told her plainly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
brutally, clumsily, without preface, without comment:
"Honey, you are going to have a child."</p>

<p>For a second her mind wavered before him. He
could actually see the totter in her eyes, and braced
himself for the final hopeless crash, but suddenly
all her being focused to the realization of his words,
and she pushed at him with her hands and cried:
"No&mdash;No&mdash;Oh, my God&mdash;<i>n-o!</i>" and fainted
in his arms.</p>

<p>When she woke up again the little-girl look was
all gone from her face, and though the Young Doctor
smiled and smiled and smiled, he could not smile
it back again. She just lay and watched him questioningly.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," he whispered at last, "do you remember
what I told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered gravely, "I remember that,
but I don't remember what it means. Is it all right?
Is it all right to <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Young Doctor, "it's&mdash;all&mdash;right
to&mdash;me."</p>

<p>Then the Sick-A-Bed Lady turned her little face
wearily away on her pillow and went back to those
dreams of hers which no one could fathom.</p>

<p>For all the dragging weeks and months that followed
she lay in her bed or groped her way round
her room in a sort of timid stupor. Whenever the
Young Doctor was there she clung to him desperately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and seemed to find her only comfort in his
presence, but when she talked to him it was babbling
talk of things and places he could not understand.
All the village feared for the imminent tragedy in
the great white house, and mourned the pathetic absence
of the young husband, and the Young Doctor
went his sorrowful way cursing that other "boy"
who had wrought this final disaster on a girl's life.</p>

<p>But when the Sick-A-Bed Lady's hour of trial
came and some one held the merciful cone of ether
to her face, the Sick-A-Bed Lady took one deep,
heedless breath, then gave suddenly a great gasp,
snatched the cone from her face, struggled up and
stretched out her arms and cried, "Boy&mdash;Boy!"</p>

<p>The Young Doctor came running to her and saw
that her eyes were big and startled and sharp with
terror:</p>

<p>"Oh, Boy&mdash;<i>Boy</i>," she cried, "the Ether!&mdash;I
remember <i>everything</i> now&mdash;I&mdash;was his wife&mdash;the
Old Doctor's Wife!"</p>

<p>The Young Doctor tried to replace the cone, but
she beat at him furiously with her hands, crying:</p>

<p>"No, No, No!&mdash;If you give me Ether I shall die
thinking of him!&mdash;Oh, no!&mdash;<i>n-o!</i>"</p>

<p>The Young Doctor's face was like chalk. His
knees shook under him.</p>

<p>"My God!" he said, "what <i>can</i> I give you!"</p>

<p>The Sick-A-Bed Lady looked up at him and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
smiled a tortured, gallant smile. "Give me something
to keep me here," she gasped! "Give me a
token of you! Give me your little briarwood pipe
to smell&mdash;and give it to me&mdash;quickly!"</p>

<h2>HICKORY DOCK</h2>

<div class='copyright'>Used by permission of <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>.</div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="162" height="164" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HIS is the story of Hickory Dock,
and of a Man and a Girl who
trifled with Time.</div>

<p>Hickory Dock was a clock, and,
of course, the Man, being a man,
called it a clock, but the Girl,
being a girl, called it a Hickory Dock for no more
legitimate reason than that once upon a time</p>

<div  class='poem'>
"Hickory, Dickory, Dock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A Mouse ran up the Clock."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>&mdash;Girls are funny things.</div>

<p>The Man and the Girl were very busy collecting
a Home&mdash;in one room. They were just as poor as
Art and Music could make them, but poverty does
not matter much to lovers. The Man had collected
the Girl, a wee diamond ring, a big Morris chair,
two or three green and rose rugs, a shiny chafing-dish,
and various incidentals. The Girl was no less
discriminating. She had accumulated the Man, a
Bagdad couch-cover, half-a-dozen pictures, a huge
gilt mirror, three or four bits of fine china and silver,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and a fair-sized boxful of lace and ruffles that
idled under the couch until the Wedding-Day. The
room was strikingly homelike, masculinely homelike,
in all its features, but it was by no means home&mdash;yet.
No place is home until <i>two</i> people have latch-keys.
The Girl wore <i>her</i> key ostentatiously on a
long, fine chain round her neck, but its mate hung
high and dusty on a brass hook over the fireplace,
and the sight of it teased the Man more than anything
else that had ever happened to him in his life.
The Girl was easily mistress of the situation, but
the Man, you see, was not yet Master.</p>

<p>It was tacitly understood that if the Wedding-Day
<i>ever</i> arrived, the Girl should slip the extra key
into her husband's hand the very first second that
the Minister closed his eyes for the blessing. She
would have chosen to do this openly in exchange
for her ring, but the Man contended that it might
not be legal to be married with a latch-key&mdash;some
ministers are so particular. It was a joke, anyway&mdash;everything
except the Wedding-Day itself.
Meanwhile Hickory Dock kept track of the passing
hours.</p>

<p>When the Man first brought Hickory Dock to the
Girl, in a mysteriously pulsating tissue-paper package,
the Girl pretended at once that she thought it
was a dynamite bomb, and dropped it precipitously
on the table and sought immediate refuge in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Man's arms, from which propitious haven she ventured
forth at last and picked up the package gingerly,
and rubbed her cheek against it&mdash;after the
manner of girls with bombs. Then she began to tug
at the string and tear at the paper.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a Hickory Dock!" she exclaimed
with delight,&mdash;"a real, live Hickory Dock!" and
brandished the gift on high to the imminent peril of
time and chance, and then fled back to the Man's
arms with no excuse whatsoever. She was a bold
little lover.</p>

<p>"But it's a <i>c-l-o-c-k</i>," remonstrated the Man with
whimsical impatience. He had spent half his
month's earnings on the gift. "Why can't you call
it a clock? Why can't you <i>ever</i> call things by their
right names?"</p>

<p>Then the Girl dimpled and blushed and burrowed
her head in his shoulder, and whispered humbly,
"Right name? Right names? Call things by their
right names? Would you rather I called <i>you</i> by
your right name&mdash;Mr. James Herbert Humphrey
Jason?"</p>

<p><i>That</i> settled the matter&mdash;settled it so hard that
the Girl had to whisper the Man's wrong name
seven times in his ear before he was satisfied. No
man is practical about everything.</p>

<p>There are a good many things to do when you are
in love, but the Girl did not mean that the <i>Art of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Conversation</i> should be altogether lost, so she
plunged for a topic.</p>

<p>"I think it was beautiful of you to give me a
Hickory Dock," she ventured at last.</p>

<p>The Man shifted a trifle uneasily and laughed.
"I thought perhaps it would please you," he stammered.
"You see, now I have given you <i>all my
time</i>."</p>

<p>The Girl chuckled with amused delight. "Yes&mdash;all
your time. And it's nice to have a Hickory
Dock that says 'Till he comes! Till he comes!
Till he comes!'"</p>

<p>"Till he comes to&mdash;<i>stay</i>," persisted the Man.
There was no sparkle in his sentiment. He said
things very plainly, but his words drove the Girl
across the room to the window with her face flaming.
He jumped and followed her, and caught her
almost roughly by the shoulder and turned her
round.</p>

<p>"Rosalie, Rosalie," he demanded, "will you love
me till the <i>end of time?</i>" There was no gallantry
in his face but a great, dogged persistency that
frightened the Girl into a flippant answer. She
brushed her fluff of hair across his face and struggled
away from him.</p>

<p>"I will love you," she teased, "until&mdash;the clock
stops."</p>

<p>Then the Man burst out laughing, suddenly and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
unexpectedly, like a boy, and romped her back again
across the room, and snatched up the clock and stole
away the key.</p>

<p>"Hickory Dock shall <i>never</i> stop!" he cried triumphantly.
"I will wind it till I die. And no one
else must ever meddle with it."</p>

<p>"But suppose you forget?" the Girl suggested
half wistfully.</p>

<p>"I shall <i>never</i> forget," said the Man. "I will
wind Hickory Dock every week as long as I live. I
<i>p-r-o-m-i-s-e!</i>" His lips shut almost defiantly.</p>

<p>"But it isn't fair," the Girl insisted. "It isn't
fair for me to let you make such a long promise.
You&mdash;might&mdash;stop&mdash;loving me." Her eyes
filled quickly with tears. "Promise me just for
one year,"&mdash;she stamped her foot,&mdash;"I won't take
any other promise."</p>

<p>So, half provoked and half amused, the Man
bound himself then and there for the paltry term of
a year. But to fulfil his own sincerity and seriousness
he took the clock and stopped it for a moment
that he might start it up again with the Girl close in
his arms. A half-frightened, half-willing captive,
she stood in her prison and looked with furtive eyes
into the little, potential face of Hickory Dock.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;and I&mdash;for&mdash;<i>all time</i>," whispered the
Man solemnly as he started the little mechanism
throbbing once more on its way, and he stooped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
down to seal the pledge with a kiss, but once more
the significance of his word and act startled the
Girl, and she clutched at the clock and ran across the
room with it, and set it down very hard on her desk
beside the Man's picture. Then, half ashamed of
her flight, she stooped down suddenly and patted
the little, ticking surface of ebony and glass and
silver.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful little Hickory Dock," she
mused softly. "I never saw one just like it before."</p>

<p>The Man hesitated for a second and drew his
mouth into a funny twist. "I don't believe there <i>is</i>
another one like it in all the world," he acknowledged,
half laughingly,&mdash;"that is, not <i>just</i> like it.
I've had it fixed so that it won't strike <i>eleven</i>.
I'm utterly tired of having you say 'There! it's
eleven o'clock and you've <i>got</i> to go home.' <i>Now</i>,
after ten o'clock nothing can strike till twelve, and
that gives me two whole hours to use my own judgment
in."</p>

<p>The Girl took one eager step towards him, when
suddenly over the city roofs and across the square
came the hateful, strident chime of midnight. Midnight?
<i>Midnight?</i> The Girl rushed frantically to
her closet and pulled the Man's coat out from among
her fluffy dresses and thrust it into his hands, and
he fled distractedly for his train without "Good-by."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>That was the trouble with having a lover who
lived so far away and was so busy that he could
come only one evening a week. Long as you could
make that one evening, something always got
crowded out. If you made love, there was no time
to talk. If you talked, there was no time to make
love. If you spent a great time in greetings, it curtailed
your good-by. If you began your good-by
any earlier, why, it cut your evening right in two.
So the Girl sat and sulked a sad little while over
the general misery of the situation, until at last, to
comfort herself with the only means at hand, she
went over to the closet and opened the door just
wide enough to stick her nose in and sniff ecstatically.</p>

<p>"Oh! O&mdash;h!" she crooned. "O&mdash;h! What
a nice, smoky smell."</p>

<p>Then she took Hickory Dock and went to bed.
This method of bunking was nice for her, but it
played sad havoc with Hickory Dock, who lay on
his back and whizzed and whirred and spun around
at such a rate that when morning came he was minutes
and hours, not to say days, ahead of time.</p>

<p>This gain in time seemed rather an advantage to
the Girl. She felt that it was a good omen and
must in some manner hasten the Wedding-Day, but
when she confided the same to the Man at his next
visit he viewed the fact with righteous scorn, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the fancy itself pleased him mightily. The Girl
learned that night, however, to eschew Hickory
Dock as a rag doll. She did not learn this, though,
through any particular solicitude for Hickory Dock,
but rather because she had to stand by respectfully
a whole precious hour and watch the Man's lean,
clever fingers tinker with the little, jeweled mechanism.
It was a fearful waste of time. "You are
so kind to <i>little</i> things," she whispered at last, with
a catch in her voice that made the Man drop his
work suddenly and give all his attention to <i>big</i>
things. And another evening went, while Hickory
Dock stood up like a hero and refused to strike
eleven.</p>

<p>So every Sunday night throughout the Winter
and the Spring and the Summer, the Man came
joyously climbing up the long stairs to the Girl's
room, and every Sunday night Hickory Dock was
started off on a fresh round of Time and Love.</p>

<p>Hickory Dock, indeed, became a very precious
object, for both Man and Girl had reached that particular
stage of love where they craved the wonderful
sensation of owning some vital thing together.
But they were so busy loving that they did not recognize
the instinct. The man looked upon Hickory
Dock as an exceedingly blessed toy. The Girl grew
gradually to cherish the little clock with a certain
tender superstition and tingling reverence that sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
her heart pounding every time the Man's fingers
turned to any casual tinkering.</p>

<p>And the Girl grew so exquisitely dear that the
Man thought all women were like her. And the
Man grew so sturdily precious that the Girl knew
positively there was no person on earth to be compared
with him. Over this happiness Hickory
Dock presided throbbingly, and though he balked
sometimes and bolted or lagged, he never stopped,
and he never struck eleven.</p>

<p>Thus things went on in the customary way that
things do go on with men and girls&mdash;until the
Chronic Quarrel happened. The Chronic Quarrel
was a trouble quite distinct from any ordinary
lovers' disturbance, and it was a very silly little
thing like this: The Girl had a nature that was
emotionally apprehensive. She was always looking,
as it were, for "dead men in the woods."
She was always saying, "Suppose you get tired of
me?" "Suppose I died?" "Suppose I found
out that you had a wife living?" "Suppose you
lost all your legs and arms in a railroad accident
when you were coming here some Sunday night?"</p>

<p>And one day the Man had snapped her short
with "Suppose? Suppose? What arrant nonsense!
Suppose?&mdash;Suppose I fall in love with
the Girl in the Office?"</p>

<p>It seemed to him the most extravagant supposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that he could possibly imagine, and he was
perfectly delighted with its effect on his Sweetheart.
She grew silent at once and very wistful.</p>

<p>After that he met all her apprehensions with
"Suppose?&mdash;Suppose I fall in love with the Girl
in the Office!"</p>

<p>And one day the Girl looked up at him with hot
tears in her eyes and said tersely, "Well, why don't
you fall in love with her if you <i>want</i> to?"</p>

<p>That, of course, made a little trouble, but it was
delicious fun making up, and the "Girl in the
Office" became gradually one of those irresistibly
dangerous jokes that always begin with laughter
and end just as invariably with tears. When the
Girl was sad or blue the Man was clumsy enough
to try and cheer her with facetious allusions to the
"Girl in the Office," and when the Girl was supremely,
radiantly happy she used to boast, "Why,
I'm so happy I don't care a <i>rap</i> about your old
'Girl in the Office.'" But whatever way the joke
began, it always ended disastrously, with bitterness
and tears, yet neither Man nor Girl could bear
to formally taboo the subject lest it should look
like the first shirking of their perfect intimacy and
freedom of speech. The Man felt that in love like
theirs he ought to be able to say anything he wanted
to, so he kept on saying it, while the Girl claimed
an equal if more caustic liberty of expression, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the Chronic Quarrel began to fester a little round
its edges.</p>

<p>One night in November, when Hickory Dock
was nearly a year old in love, the Chronic Quarrel
came to a climax. The Man was very listless that
evening, and absent-minded, and altogether inadequate.
The Girl accused him of indifference. He
accused her in return of a shrewish temper. She
suggested that perhaps he regretted his visit. He
failed to contradict her. Then the Girl drew herself
up to an absurd height for so small a creature
and said stiffly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You don't have to come next Sunday night if
you don't want to."</p>

<p>At her scathing words the Man straightened up
very suddenly in his chair and gazed over at the
little clock in a startled sort of way.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I shall come," he retorted impulsively,
"Hickory Dock needs me, if you don't."</p>

<p>"Oh, come and wind the clock by all means,"
flared the Girl. "I'm glad <i>something</i> needs
you!"</p>

<p>Then the Man followed his own judgment and
went home, though it was only ten o'clock.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to write to him this week,"
sobbed poor Rosalie. "I think he's very disagreeable."</p>

<p>But when the next Sunday came and the Man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was <i>late</i>, it seemed as though an Eternity had been
tacked onto a hundred years. It was fully quarter-past
eight before he came climbing up the
stairs.</p>

<p>The Girl looked scornfully at the clock. Her
throat ached like a bruise. "You didn't hurry
yourself much, did you?" she asked spitefully.</p>

<p>The Man looked up quickly and bit his lip.
"The train was late," he replied briefly. He did
not stop to take off his coat, but walked over to
the table and wound Hickory Dock. Then he hesitated
the smallest possible fraction of a moment,
but the Girl made no move, so he picked up his hat
and started for the door.</p>

<p>The Girl's heart sank, but her pride rose proportionally.
"Is that all you came for?" she
flushed. "Good! I am very tired to-night."</p>

<p>Then the Man went away. She counted every
footfall on the stairs. In the little hush at the street
doorway she felt that he must surely turn and come
running back again, breathless and eager, with outstretched
arms and all the kisses she was starving
for. But when she heard the front door slam with
a vicious finality she went and threw herself, sobbing
on the couch. "Fifty miles just to wind a
clock!" she raged in grief and chagrin. "I'll
punish him for it if that's all he comes for."</p>

<p>So the next Sunday night she took Hickory Dock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with a cruel jerk, and put him on the floor just
outside her door, and left a candle burning so that
the Man could not possibly fail to see what was
intended. "If all he comes for is to wind the
clock, just because he <i>promised</i>, there's no earthly
use of his coming in," she reasoned, and went into
her room and shut and locked her door, waiting
nervously with clutched hands for the footfall on
the stairs. "He loves some one else! He loves
some one else!" she kept prodding herself.</p>

<p>Just at eight o'clock the Man came. She heard
him very distinctly on the creaky board at the
head of the stairs, and her heart beat to suffocation.
Then she heard him come close to the door,
as though he stooped down, and then he&mdash;laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," thought the Girl. "So he
thinks it's funny, does he? He has no business
to laugh while I am crying, even if he does love
some one else.&mdash;I <i>hate him!</i>"</p>

<p>The Man knocked on the door very softly, and
the Girl gripped tight hold of her chair for fear
she should jump up and let him in. He knocked
again, and she heard him give a strange little gasp
of surprise. Then he tried the door-handle. It
turned fatuously, but the door would not open.
He pushed his weight against it,&mdash;she could almost
feel the soft whirr of his coat on the wood,&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the door would not yield.&mdash;Then he turned
very suddenly and went away.</p>

<p>The Girl got up with a sort of gloating look, as
though she liked her pain. "Next Sunday night
is the last Sunday night of his year's promise," she
brooded; "then everything will be over. He will
see how wise I was not to let him promise forever
and ever. I will send Hickory Dock to him by
express to save his coming for the final ceremony."
Then she went out and got Hickory Dock and
brought him in and shook him, but Hickory Dock
continued to tick, "Till he comes! Till he comes!
Till he comes!"</p>

<p>It was a very tedious week. It is perfectly absurd
to measure a week by the fact that seven days
make it&mdash;some days are longer than others. By
Wednesday the Girl's proud little heart had capitulated
utterly, and she decided not to send Hickory
Dock away by express, but to let things take their
natural course. And every time she thought of the
"natural course" her heart began to pound with expectation.
Of course, she would not acknowledge
that she really expected the Man to come after her
cruel treatment of him the previous week. "Everything
is over. Everything is over," she kept
preaching to herself with many gestures and illustrations;
but next to God she put her faith in promises,
and hadn't the Man promised a great, sacred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
lover's promise that he would come every Sunday
for a year? So when the final Sunday actually
came she went to her wedding-box and took out her
"second best" of everything, silk and ruffles and
laces, and dressed herself up for sheer pride and
joy, with tingling thoughts of the night when
she should wear her "first best" things. She
put on a soft, little, white Summer dress that
the Man liked better than anything else, and stuck
a pink bow in her hair, and big rosettes on her
slippers, and drew the big Morris chair towards
the fire, and brought the Man's pipe and tobacco-box
from behind the gilt mirror. Then she took
Hickory Dock very tenderly and put him outside
the door, with two pink candles flaming beside
him, and a huge pink rose over his left ear. She
thought the Man could smell the rose the second
he opened the street door. Then she went back to
her room, and left her door a wee crack open, and
crouched down on the floor close to it, like a happy,
wounded thing, and <i>waited</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>But the Man did not come. Eight o'clock, nine
o'clock, ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock,
she waited, cramped and cold, hoping against hope,
fearing against fear. Every creak on the stairs
thrilled her. Every fresh disappointment chilled
her right through to her heart. She sat and
rocked herself in a huddled heap of pain, she taunted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
herself with lack of spirit, she goaded herself with
intricate remorse&mdash;but she never left her bitter
vigil until half-past two. Then some clatter of
milkmen in the street roused her to the realization
of a new day, and she got up dazed and icy, like
one in a dream, and limped over to her couch and
threw herself down to sleep like a drunken person.</p>

<p>Late the next morning she woke heavily with a
vague, dull sense of loss which she could not immediately
explain. She lay and looked with astonishment
at the wrinkled folds of the white mull
dress that bound her limbs like a shroud. She
clutched at the tightness of her collar, and fingered
with surprise the pink bow in her hair. Then
slowly, one by one, the events of the previous night
came back to her in all their significance, and with
a muffled scream of heartbreak she buried her face
in the pillow. She cried till her heart felt like a
clenched fist within her, and then, with her passion
exhausted, she got up like a little, cold, rumpled
ghost and pattered out to the hall in her silk-stockinged
feet, and picked up Hickory Dock with his
wilted pink rose and brought him in and put him
back on her desk. Then she brought in the mussy,
pink-smooched candlesticks and stowed them far
away in her closet behind everything else. The
faintest possible scent of tobacco-smoke came to
her from the closet depths, and as she reached instinctively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to take a sad little whiff she became suddenly
conscious that there was a strange, uncanny
<i>hush</i> in the room, as though a soul had left its
body. She turned back quickly and cried out with
a smothered cry. Hickory Dock had stopped!</p>

<p>"Until&mdash;the&mdash;end&mdash;of&mdash;Time," she gasped,
and staggered hard against the closet-door. Then
in a flash she burst out laughing stridently, and
rushed for Hickory Dock and grabbed him by his
little silver handle, opened the window with a bang,
and threw him with all her might and main down
into the brick alley four stories below, where he
fell with a sickening crash among a wee handful
of scattered rose petals.</p>

<p>&mdash;The days that followed were like horrid
dreams, the nights, like hideous realities. The fire
would not burn. The sun and moon would not
shine, and life itself settled down like a pall.
Every detail of that Sunday night stamped and re stamped
itself upon her mind. Back of her outraged
love was the crueller pain of her outraged
faith. The Man of his own free will had made a
sacred promise and broken it! She realized now
for the first time in her life why men went to the
devil because women had failed them&mdash;not disappointed
them, but <i>failed</i> them! She could even
imagine how poor mothers felt when fathers
shirked their fatherhood. She tasted in one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
week's imagination all possible woman sorrows of
the world.</p>

<p>At the end of the second week she began to realize
the depth of isolation into which her engagement
had thrown her. For a year and a half she
had thought nothing, dreamed nothing, cared for
nothing except the Man. Now, with the Man
swept away, there was no place to turn either for
comfort or amusement.</p>

<p>At the end of the third week, when no word
came, she began to gather together all the Man's
little personal effects, and consigned them to a box
out of sight&mdash;the pipe and tobacco, a favorite
book, his soft Turkish slippers, his best gloves, and
even a little poem which he had written for her
to set to music. It was a pretty little love-song
that they had made together, but as she hummed it
over now for the last time she wondered if, after
all, <i>woman's music</i> did not do more than man's
words to make love Singable.</p>

<p>When a month was up she began to strip the
room of everything that the Man had brought towards
the making of their Home. It was like stripping
tendons. She had never realized before how
thoroughly the Man's personality had dominated
her room as well as her life. When she had
crowded his books, his pictures, his college trophies,
his Morris chair, his rugs, into one corner of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
room and covered them with two big sheets, her
little, paltry, feminine possessions looked like chiffon
in a desert.</p>

<p>While she was pondering what to do next her
rent fell due. The month's idling had completely
emptied her pewter savings-bank that she had been
keeping as a sort of precious joke for the Honeymoon.
The rent-bill startled her into spasmodic
efforts at composition. She had been quite busy
for a year writing songs for some Educational
people, but how could one make harmony with a
heart full of discord and all life off the key. A
single week convinced her of the utter futility of
these efforts. In one high-strung, wakeful night
she decided all at once to give up the whole struggle
and go back to her little country village, where
at least she would find free food and shelter until
she could get her grip again.</p>

<p>For three days she struggled heroically with
burlap and packing-boxes. She felt as though
every nail she pounded was hurting the Man as well
as herself, and she pounded just as hard as she
possibly could.</p>

<p>When the room was stripped of every atom of
personality except her couch, and the duplicate
latch-key, which still hung high and dusty, a deliciously
cruel thought came to the Girl, and the
irony of it set her eyes flashing. On the night before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
her intended departure she took the key and
put it into a pretty little box and sent it to the
Man.</p>

<p>"He'll know by that token," she said, "that
there's no more 'Home' for him and me. He
will get his furniture a few days later, and then
he will see that everything is scattered and shattered.
Even if he's married by this time, the
key will hurt him, for his wife will want to know
what it means, and he never can tell her."</p>

<p>Then she cried so hard that her overwrought,
half-starved little body collapsed, and she crept
into her bed and was sick all night and all the next
day, so that there was no possible thought or chance
of packing or traveling. But towards the second
evening she struggled up to get herself a taste of
food and wine from her cupboard, and, wrapping
herself in her pink kimono, huddled over the fire
to try and find a little blaze and cheer.</p>

<p>Just as the flames commenced to flush her cheeks
the lock clicked. She started up in alarm. The
door opened abruptly, and the Man strode in with
a very determined, husbandly look on his haggard
face. For the fraction of a second he stood and
looked at her pitifully frightened and disheveled
little figure.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he cried, "but I <i>had</i> to come
like this." Then he took one mighty stride and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
caught her up in his arms and carried her back
to her open bed and tucked her in like a child
while she clung to his neck laughing and sobbing
and crying as though her brain was turned. He
smoothed her hair, he kissed her eyes, he rubbed
his rough cheek confidently against her soft one,
and finally, when her convulsive tremors quieted a
little, he reached down into his great overcoat
pocket and took out poor, battered, mutilated Hickory
Dock.</p>

<p>"I found him down in the Janitor's office just
now," he explained, and his mouth twitched just
the merest trifle at the corners.</p>

<p>"Don't smile," said the Girl, sitting up suddenly
very straight and stiff. "Don't smile till you
know the whole truth. <i>I</i> broke Hickory Dock.
I threw him <i>purposely</i> four stories down into the
brick alley!"</p>

<p>The Man began to examine Hickory Dock very
carefully.</p>

<p>"I should judge that it was a <i>brick</i> alley," he
remarked with an odd twist of his lips, as he tossed
the shattered little clock over to the burlap-covered
armchair.</p>

<p>Then he took the Girl very quietly and tenderly
in his arms again, and gazed down into her eyes
with a look that was new to him.</p>

<p>"Rosalie," he whispered, "I will mend Hickory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Dock for you if it takes a thousand years,"&mdash;his
voice choked,&mdash;"but I wish to God I could mend
my broken promise as easily!"</p>

<p>And Rosalie smiled through her tears and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sweetheart-Man, you do love me?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart and soul and body and
breath, and past and present and future I <i>love
you!</i>" said the Man.</p>

<p>Then Rosalie kissed a little path to his ear, and
whispered, oh, so softly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sweetheart-Man, I love <i>you</i> just that same
way."</p>

<p>And Hickory Dock, the Angel, never ticked the
passing of a single second, but lay on his back
looking straight up to Heaven with his two little
battered hands clasped eternally at Love's <i>high
noon</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE VERY TIRED GIRL</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/drop_o.png" width="165" height="164" alt="O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />N one of those wet, warm, slushy
February nights when the vapid
air sags like sodden wool in your
lungs, and your cheek-bones bore
through your flesh, and your
leaden feet seem strung directly
from the roots of your eyes, three girls stampeded
their way through the jostling, peevish street
crowds with no other object in Heaven or Earth
except just to get&mdash;HOME.</div>

<p>It was supper time, too, somewhere between six
and seven, the caved-in hour of the day when the
ruddy ghost of Other People's dinners flaunts itself
rather grossly in the pallid nostrils of Her Who
Lives by the Chafing-Dish.</p>

<p>One of the girls was a Medical Masseuse, trained
brain and brawn in the German Hospitals. One
was a Public School Teacher with a tickle of chalk
dust in her lungs. One was a Cartoon Artist with
a heart like chiffon and a wit as accidentally malicious
as the jab of a pin in a flirt's belt.</p>

<p>All three of them were silly with fatigue. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
writhing city cavorted before them like a sick clown.
A lame cab horse went strutting like a mechanical
toy. Crape on a door would have plunged them
into hysterics. Were you ever as tired as that?</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/gs02.jpg" width="418" height="400" alt="With no other object, except to get home" title="" />
<span class="caption">With no other object, except to get home</span>
</div>
<p>It was, in short, the kind of night that rips out
every one according to his stitch. Rhoda Hanlan
the Masseuse was ostentatiously sewed with double
thread and backstitched at that. Even the little
Teacher, Ruth MacLaurin, had a physique that was
embroidered if not darned across its raveled places.
But Noreen Gaudette, the Cartoon Drawer, with
her spangled brain and her tissue-paper body, was
merely basted together with a single silken thread.
It was the knowledge of being only basted that
gave Noreen the droll, puckered terror in her eyes
whenever Life tugged at her with any specially inordinate
strain.</p>

<p>Yet it was Noreen who was popularly supposed
to be built with an electric battery instead of a
heart.</p>

<p>The boarding-house that welcomed the three was
rather tall for beauty, narrow-shouldered, flat-chested,
hunched together in the block like a prudish,
dour old spinster overcrowded in a street car.
To call such a house "Home" was like calling such
a spinster "Mother." But the three girls called it
"Home" and rather liked the saucy taste of the
word in their mouths.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Across the threshold in a final spurt of energy
the jaded girls pushed with the joyous realization
that there were now only five flights of stairs between
themselves and their own attic studio.</p>

<p>On the first floor the usual dreary vision greeted
them of a hall table strewn with stale letters&mdash;most
evidently bills, which no one seemed in a hurry
to appropriate.</p>

<p>It was twenty-two stumbling, bundle-dropping
steps to the next floor, where the strictly Bachelor
Quarters with half-swung doors emitted a pleasant
gritty sound of masculine voices, and a sumptuous
cloud of cigarette smoke which led the way frowardly
up twenty-two more toiling steps to the Old
Maid's Floor, buffeted itself naughtily against the
sternly shut doors, and then mounted triumphantly
like sweet incense to the Romance Floor, where
with door alluringly open the Much-Loved Girl and
her Mother were frankly and ingenuously preparing
for the Monday-Night-Lover's visit.</p>

<p>The vision of the Much-Loved Girl smote like a
brutal flashlight upon the three girls in the hall.</p>

<p>Out of curl, out of breath, jaded of face, bedraggled
of clothes, they stopped abruptly and stared
into the vista.</p>

<p>Before their fretted eyes the room stretched fresh
and clean as a newly returned laundry package.
The green rugs lay like velvet grass across the floor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
The chintz-covered furniture crisped like the crust
of a cake. Facing the gilt-bound mirror, the
Much-Loved Girl sat joyously in all her lingerie-waisted,
lace-paper freshness, while her Mother
hovered over her to give one last maternal touch to
a particularly rampageous blond curl.</p>



<p>The Much-Loved Girl was a cordial person.
Her liquid, mirrored reflection nodded gaily out
into the hall. There was no fatigue in the sparkling
face. There was no rain or fog. There was
no street-corner insult. There was no harried
stress of wherewithal. There was just Youth, and
Girl, and Cherishing.</p>

<p>She made the Masseuse and the little School
Teacher think of a pale-pink rose in a cut-glass
vase. But she made Noreen Gaudette <i>feel</i> like a
vegetable in a boiled dinner.</p>

<p>With one despairing gasp&mdash;half-chuckle and
half-sob&mdash;the three girls pulled themselves together
and dashed up the last flight of stairs to
the Trunk-Room Floor, and their own attic studio,
where bumping through the darkness they turned
a sulky stream of light upon a room more tired-looking
than themselves, and then, with almost
fierce abandon, collapsed into the nearest resting-places
that they could reach.</p>

<p>It was a long time before any one spoke.</p>

<p>Between the treacherous breeze of the open window<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and a withering blast of furnace heat the
wilted muslin curtain swayed back and forth with
languid rhythm. Across the damp night air came
faintly the yearning, lovery smell of violets, and
the far-off, mournful whine of a sick hand-organ.</p>

<p>On the black fur hearth-rug Rhoda, the red-haired,
lay prostrated like a broken tiger lily with
her long, lithe hands clutched desperately at her
temples.</p>

<p>"I am so tired," she said. "I am so tired that
I can actually feel my hair fade."</p>

<p>Ruth, the little Public School Teacher, laughed
derisively from her pillowed couch where she struggled
intermittently with her suffocating collar and
the pinchy buckles on her overshoes.</p>

<p>"That's nothing," she asserted wanly. "I am
so tired that I would like to build me a pink-wadded
silk house, just the shape of a slipper, where
I could snuggle down in the toe and go to sleep for
a&mdash;million years. It isn't to-morrow's early
morning that racks me, it's the thought of all the
early mornings between now and the Judgment
Day. Oh, any sentimental person can cry at night,
but when you begin to cry in the morning&mdash;to lie
awake and cry in the morning&mdash;" Her face sickened
suddenly. "Did you see that Mother downstairs?"
she gasped, "fixing that curl? Think of
having a Mother!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Noreen Gaudette opened her great gray
eyes and grinned diabolically. She had a funny
little manner of cartooning her emotions.</p>

<p>"Think of having a Mother?" she scoffed.
"What nonsense!&mdash;<i>Think of having a c-u-r-l!</i></p>

<p>"You talk like Sunday-Paper d&eacute;butantes," she
drawled. "You don't know anything about being
tired. Why, I am so tired&mdash;I am so tired&mdash;that
I wish&mdash;I wish that the first man who ever proposed
to me would come back and ask me&mdash;<i>again!</i>"</p>

<p>It was then that the Landlady, knocking at the
door, presented a card, "Mr. Ernest T. Dextwood,"
for Miss Gaudette, and the innocent-looking
conversation exploded suddenly like a short-fused
firecracker.</p>

<p>Rhoda in an instant was sitting bolt upright with
her arms around her knees rocking to and fro in
convulsive delight. Ruth much more thoughtfully
jumped for Noreen's bureau drawer. But Noreen
herself, after one long, hyphenated "Oh, my
<i>H-e-a-v-e-n-s!</i>" threw off her damp, wrinkled coat,
stalked over to the open window, and knelt down
quiveringly where she could smother her blazing
face in the inconsequent darkness.</p>

<p>For miles and miles the teasing lights of Other
Women's homes stretched out before her. From
the window-sill below her rose the persistent purple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
smell of violets, and the cooing, gauzy laughter of
the Much-Loved Girl. Fatigue was in the damp
air, surely, but Spring was also there, and Lonesomeness,
and worst of all, that desolating sense of
patient, dying snow wasting away before one's eyes
like Life itself.</p>

<p>When Noreen turned again to her friends her
eyelids drooped defiantly across her eyes. Her lips
were like a scarlet petal under the bite of her teeth.
There in the jetty black and scathing white of her
dress she loomed up suddenly like one of her own
best drawings&mdash;pulseless ink and stale white paper
vitalized all in an instant by some miraculous emotional
power. A living Cartoon of "<i>Fatigue</i>" she
stood there&mdash;"<i>Fatigue</i>," as she herself would have
drawn it&mdash;no flaccid failure of wilted bone and
sagging flesh, but <i>Verve</i>&mdash;the taut Brain's pitiless
rally of the Body that can not afford to rest&mdash;the
verve of Factory Lights blazing overtime, the verve
of the Runner who drops at his goal.</p>

<p>"All the time I am gone," she grinned, "pray
over and over, 'Lead Noreen not into temptation.'"
Her voice broke suddenly into wistful laughter:
"Why to meet again a man who used to love
you&mdash;it's like offering store-credit to a pauper."</p>

<p>Then she slammed the door behind her and started
downstairs for the bleak, plush parlor, with a
chaotic sense of absurdity and bravado.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>But when she reached the middle of the bachelor
stairway and looked down casually and spied her
clumsy arctics butting out from her wet-edged skirt
all her nervousness focused instantly in her shaking
knees, and she collapsed abruptly on the friendly
dark stair and clutching hold of the banister, began
to whimper.</p>

<p>In the midst of her stifled tears a door banged
hard above her, the floor creaked under a sturdy
step, and the tall, narrow form of the Political
Economist silhouetted itself against the feeble light
of the upper landing.</p>

<p>One step down he came into the darkness&mdash;two
steps, three steps, four, until at last in choking miserable
embarrassment, Noreen cried out hysterically:</p>

<p>"Don't step on me&mdash;I'm <i>crying!</i>"</p>

<p>With a gasp of astonishment the young man
struck a sputtering match and bent down waving it
before him.</p>

<p>"Why, it's <i>you</i>, Miss Gaudette," he exclaimed
with relief. "What's the matter? Are you ill?
What are you crying about?" and he dropped down
beside her and commenced to fan her frantically
with his hat.</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you crying about?" he persisted helplessly,
drugged man-like, by the same embarrassment
that mounted like wine to the woman's brain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Noreen began to laugh snuffingly.</p>

<p>"I'm not crying about anything special," she
acknowledged. "I'm just crying. I'm crying
partly because I'm tired&mdash;and partly because I've
got my overshoes on&mdash;but <i>mostly</i>"&mdash;her voice began
to catch again&mdash;"but mostly&mdash;because there's
a <i>man</i> waiting to see me in the parlor."</p>

<p>The Political Economist shifted uneasily in his
rain coat and stared into Noreen's eyes.</p>

<p>"Great Heavens!" he stammered. "Do you always
cry when men come to see you? Is that why
you never invited <i>me</i> to call?"</p>

<p>Noreen shook her head. "I never have men
come to see me," she answered quite simply. "I
go to see <i>them</i>. I study in their studios. I work
on their newspapers. I caricature their enemies.
Oh, it isn't <i>men</i> that I'm afraid of," she added
blithely, "but <i>this</i> is something particular. <i>This</i>
is something really very funny. Did you ever make
a wish that something perfectly preposterous would
happen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the Political Economist reassuringly.
"This very day I said that I wished my
Stenographer would swallow the telephone."</p>

<p>"But she didn't swallow it, did she?" persisted
Noreen triumphantly. "Now I said that I wished
some one would swallow the telephone and she <i>did</i>
swallow it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Then her face in the dusky light flared piteously
with harlequined emotions. Her eyes blazed bright
with toy excitement. Her lips curved impishly with
exaggerated drollery. But when for a second her
head drooped back against the banister her jaded
small face looked for all the world like a death-mask
of a Jester.</p>

<p>The Political Economist's heart crinkled uncomfortably
within him.</p>

<p>"Why, you poor little girl," he said. "I didn't
know that women got as tired as that. Let me take
off your overshoes."</p>

<p>Noreen stood up like a well-trained pony and shed
her clumsy footgear.</p>

<p>The Man's voice grew peremptory. "Your skirt
is sopping wet. Are you crazy? Didn't have time
to get into dry things? Nonsense! Have you had
any supper? What? <i>N-o?</i> Wait a minute."</p>

<p>In an instant he was flying up the stairs, and when
he came back there was a big glass of cool milk in
his hand.</p>

<p>Noreen drank it ravenously, and then started
downstairs with abrupt, quick courage.</p>

<p>When she reached the ground floor the Political
Economist leaned over the banisters and shouted in
a piercing whisper:</p>

<p>"I'll leave your overshoes outside my door
where you can get them on your way up later."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he laughed teasingly and added: "I&mdash;hope&mdash;you'll&mdash;have&mdash;a&mdash;good&mdash;time."</p>

<p>And Noreen, cleaving for one last second to the
outer edge of the banisters, smiled up at him, so
strainingly <i>up</i>, that her face, to the man above her,
looked like a little flat white plate with a crimson-lipped
rose wilting on it.</p>

<p>Then she disappeared into the parlor.</p>

<p>With equal abruptness the Political Economist
changed his mind about going out, and went back
instead to his own room and plunged himself down
in his chair, and smoked and thought, until his
friend, the Poet at the big writing-desk, slapped
down his manuscript and stared at him inquisitively.</p>

<p>"Lord Almighty! I wish I could draw!" said
the Political Economist. It was not so much an
exclamation as a reverent entreaty. His eyes narrowed
sketchily across the vision that haunted him.
"If I could draw," he persisted, "I'd make a picture
that would hit the world like a knuckled fist
straight between its selfish old eyes. And I'd call
that picture 'Talent.' I'd make an ocean chopping
white and squally, with <i>black</i> clouds scudding like
fury across the sky, and no land in sight except
rocks. And I'd fill that ocean full of sharks and
things&mdash;not showing too much, you know, but just
an occasional shimmer of fins through the foam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
And I'd make a sailboat scooting along, tipped 'way
over on her side toward you, with just a slip of an
eager-faced girl in it. And I'd wedge her in there,
wind-blown, spray-dashed, foot and back braced to
the death, with the tiller in one hand and the sheet
in the other, and weather-almighty roaring all
around her. And I'd make the riskiest little leak
in the bottom of that boat rammed desperately with
a box of chocolates, and a bunch of violets, and a
large paper compliment in a man's handwriting
reading: 'Oh, how <i>clever</i> you are.' And I'd have
that girl's face haggard with hunger, starved for
sleep, tense with fear, ravished with excitement.
But I'd have her chin <i>up</i>, and her eyes <i>open</i>, and
the tiniest tilt of a quizzical smile hounding you like
mad across the snug, gilt frame. Maybe, too, I'd
have a woman's magazine blowing around telling in
chaste language how to keep the hair 'smooth' and
the hands 'velvety,' and admonishing girls above all
things not to be eaten by sharks! Good Heavens,
Man!" he finished disjointedly, "a girl doesn't
know how to sail a boat anyway!"</p>

<p>"<i>W-h-a-t</i> are you talking about?" moaned the
Poet.</p>

<p>The Political Economist began to knock the ashes
furiously out of his pipe.</p>

<p>"What am I talking about?" he cried; "I'm
talking about <i>girls</i>. I've always said that I'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
gladly fall in love if I only could decide what kind
of a girl I wanted to fall in love with. Well, I've
decided!"</p>

<p>The Poet's face furrowed. "Is it the Much-Loved
Girl?" he stammered.</p>

<p>The Political Economist's smoldering temper began
to blaze.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," ejaculated the Political Economist.
"The Much-Loved Girl is a sweet enough,
airy, fairy sort of girl, but I'm not going to fall in
love with just a pretty valentine."</p>

<p>"Going to try a 'Comic'?" the Poet suggested
pleasantly.</p>

<p>The Political Economist ignored the impertinence.
"I am reasonably well off," he continued meditatively,
"and I'm reasonably good-looking, and
I've contributed eleven articles on 'Men and
Women' to modern economic literature, but it's
dawned on me all of a sudden that in spite of all
my beauteous theories regarding life in general, I
am just one big shirk when it comes to life in particular."</p>

<p>The Poet put down his pen and pushed aside his
bottle of rhyming fluid, and began to take notice.</p>

<p>"Whom are you going to fall in love with?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>The Political Economist sank back into his chair.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know," he added simply, "but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
she's going to be some tired girl. Whatever else
she may or may not be, she's got to be a tired
girl."</p>

<p>"A tired girl?" scoffed the Poet. "That's no
kind of a girl to marry. Choose somebody who's
all pink and white freshness. That's the kind of a
girl to make a man happy."</p>

<p>The Political Economist smiled a bit viciously behind
his cigar.</p>

<p>"Half an hour ago," he affirmed, "I was a beast
just like you. Good Heavens! Man," he cried out
suddenly, "did you ever see a girl cry? Really cry,
I mean. Not because her manicure scissors jabbed
her thumb, but because her great, strong, tyrant,
sexless brain had goaded her poor little woman-body
to the very cruelest, last vestige of its strength and
spirit. Did you ever see a girl like that Miss Gaudette
upstairs&mdash;she's the Artist, you know, who
did those cartoons last year that played the devil
itself with 'Congress Assembled'&mdash;did you ever
see a girl like <i>that</i> just plain thrown down, tripped
in her tracks, sobbing like a hurt, tired child? Your
pink and white prettiness can cry like a rampant
tragedy-queen all she wants to over a misfitted collar,
but my hand is going here and now to the big-brained
girl who cries like a child!"</p>

<p>"In short," interrupted the Poet, "you are going
to help&mdash;Miss Gaudette sail her boat?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Y-e-s," said the Political Economist.</p>

<p>"And so," mocked the Poet, "you are going to
jump aboard and steer the young lady adroitly to
some port of your own choosing?"</p>

<p>The older man's jaws tightened ominously.
"No, by the Lord Almighty, that's just what I am
not going to do!" he promised. "I'm going to
help her sail to the port of her own choosing!"</p>

<p>The Poet began to rummage in his mind for adequate
arguments. "Oh, allegorically," he conceded,
"your scheme is utterly charming, but from any material,
matrimonial point of view I should want to
remind myself pretty hard that overwrought brains
do not focus very easily on domestic interests, nor
do arms which have tugged as you say at 'sheets'
and 'tillers' curve very dimplingly around youngsters'
shoulders."</p>

<p>The Political Economist blew seven mighty
smoke-puffs from his pipe.</p>

<p>"That would be the economic price I deserve to
pay for not having arrived earlier on the scene," he
said quietly.</p>

<p>The Poet began to chuckle. "You certainly are
hard hit," he scoffed.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Political Economy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gone to rhyme with Hominy!</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>It's an exquisite scheme!"</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a rotten rhyme," attested the Political
Economist, and strode over to the mantelpiece,
where he began to hunt for a long piece of
twine.</p>

<p>"Miss Gaudette," he continued, "is downstairs
in the parlor now entertaining a caller&mdash;some resurrected
beau, I believe. Anyway, she left her
overshoes outside my door to get when she comes
up again, and I'm going to tie one end of this string
to them and the other end to my wrist, so that when
she picks up her shoes a few hours later it will wake
me from my nap, and I can make one grand rush
for the hall and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Propose then and there?" quizzed the Poet.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly. But I'm going to ask her if
she'll let me fall in love with her."</p>

<p>The Poet sniffed palpably and left the room.</p>

<p>But the Political Economist lay back in his chair
and went to sleep with a great, pleasant expectancy
in his heart.</p>

<p>When he woke at last with a sharp, tugging pain
at his wrist the room was utterly dark, and the little
French clock had stopped aghast and clasped its
hands at eleven.</p>

<p>For a second he rubbed his eyes in perplexity.
Then he jumped to his feet, fumbled across the
room and opened the door to find Noreen staring
with astonishment at the tied overshoes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I wanted to speak to you," he began. Then
his eyes focused in amazement on a perfectly huge
bunch of violets which Noreen was clasping desperately
in her arms.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" he cried. "Is anybody
dead?"</p>

<p>But Noreen held the violets up like a bulwark
and commenced to laugh across them.</p>

<p>"He did propose," she said, "and I accepted him!
Does it look as though I had chosen to be engaged
with violets instead of a ring?" she suggested
blithely. "It's only that I asked him if he would
be apt to send me violets, and when he said:
'Yes, every week,' I just asked if I please couldn't
have them all at once. There must be a Billion dollars'
worth here. I'm going to have a tea-party to-morrow
and invite the Much-Loved Girl." The
conscious, childish malice of her words twisted her
lips into an elfish smile. "It's Mr. Ernest Dextwood,"
she rattled on: "Ernest Dextwood, the Coffee
Merchant. He's a widower now&mdash;with three
children. Do&mdash;you&mdash;think&mdash;that&mdash;I&mdash;will&mdash;make&mdash;a&mdash;good&mdash;stepmother?"</p>

<p>The violets began to quiver against her breast,
but her chin went higher in rank defiance of the
perplexing <i>something</i> which she saw in the Political
Economist's narrowing eyes. She began to quote
with playful recklessness Byron's pert parody:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"There is a tide in the affairs of women<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which taken at its flood leads&mdash;God Knows Where."</span><br />
</div>

<p>But when the Political Economist did not answer
her, but only stared with brooding, troubled
eyes, she caught her breath with a sudden terrifying
illumination. "Ouch!" she said. "O-u-c-h!"
and wilted instantly like a frost-bitten rose under
heat. All the bravado, all the stamina, all the glint
of her, vanished utterly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Political Economist," she stammered, "Life&mdash;is&mdash;too&mdash;hard&mdash;for&mdash;me.
I am not Rhoda
Hanlan with her sturdy German peasant stock. I
am not Ruth MacLaurin with her Scotch-plaited
New Englandism. Nationality doesn't count with
me. My Father was a Violinist. My Mother was
an Actress. In order to marry, my Father
swapped his music for discordant factory noises,
and my Mother shirked a dozen successful r&ocirc;les to
give one life-long, very poor imitation of Happiness.
My Father died of too much to drink. My
Mother died of too little to eat. And I was bred,
I guess, of very bitter love, of conscious sacrifice&mdash;of
thwarted genius&mdash;of defeated vanity. Life&mdash;is&mdash;too&mdash;hard&mdash;for&mdash;me&mdash;<i>alone</i>.
I can not
finance it. I can not safeguard it. I can not weather
it. <i>I am not seaworthy!</i> You might be willing to
risk your <i>own</i> self-consciousness, but when the dead
begin to come back and clamor in you&mdash;when you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
laugh unexpectedly with your Father's restive voice&mdash;when
you quicken unexplainably to the Lure of
gilt and tinsel&mdash;" A whimper of pain went scudding
across her face, and she put back her head and
grinned&mdash;"You can keep my overshoes for a
souvenir," she finished abruptly. "I'm not allowed
any more to go out when it storms!" Then she
turned like a flash and ran swiftly up the stairs.</p>

<p>When he heard the door slam hard behind her,
the Political Economist fumbled his way back
through the darkened room to his Morris chair, and
threw himself down again. Ernest Dextwood?
He knew him well, a prosperous, kindly, yet domestically
tyrannical man, bright in the office, stupid
at home. Ernest Dextwood! So much less of a
girl would have done for him.</p>

<p>A widower with three children? The eager, unspent
emotionalism of Noreen's face flaunted itself
across his smoky vision. All that hunger for Life,
for Love, for Beauty, for Sympathy, to be blunted
once for all in a stale, misfitting, ready-made home?
A widower with three children! God in Heaven,
was she as tired as that!</p>

<p>It was a whole long week before he saw Noreen
again. When he met her at last she had just come
in from automobiling, all rosy-faced and out of
breath, with her thin little face peering almost
plumply from its heavy swathings of light-blue veiling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and her slender figure deeply wrapped in a
wondrous covert coat.</p>

<p>Rhoda Hanlan and Ruth MacLaurin were close
behind her, much more prosaically garnished in golf
capes and brown-colored mufflers. The Political
Economist stood by on the stairs to let them pass,
and Noreen looked back at him and called out
gaily:</p>

<p>"It's lots of fun to be engaged. We're all enjoying
it very much. It's bully!"</p>

<p>The next time he saw her she was on her way
downstairs to the parlor, in a long-tailed, soft, black
evening gown that bothered her a bit about managing.
Her dark hair was piled up high on her head,
and she had the same mischievous, amateur-theatrical
charm that the blue chiffon veil and covert coat
had given her.</p>

<p>Quite frankly she demanded the Political Economist's
appreciation of her appearance.</p>

<p>"Just see how nice I can look when I really try?"
she challenged him, "but it took me all day to do
it, and my work went to smash&mdash;and my dress cost
seventy dollars," she finished wryly.</p>

<p>But the Political Economist was surly about his
compliment.</p>

<p>"No, I like you better in your little business
suit," he attested gruffly. And he lied, and he knew
that he lied, for never before had he seen the shrewd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
piquancy of her eyes so utterly swamped by just the
wild, sweet lure of girlhood.</p>

<p>Some time in May, however, when the shop windows
were gay with women's luxuries, he caught a
hurried glimpse of her face gazing rather tragically
at a splurge of lilac-trimmed hats.</p>

<p>Later in the month he passed her in the Park,
cuddled up on a bench, with her shabby business suit
scrunched tight around her, her elbows on her knees,
her chin burrowed in her hands, and her fiercely
narrowed eyes quaffing like some outlawed thing at
the lusty new green grass, the splashing fountain,
the pinky flush of flowering quince. But when he
stopped to speak to her she jumped up quickly and
pleaded the haste of an errand.</p>

<p>It was two weeks later in scorching June that the
biggest warehouses on the river caught fire in the
early part of the evening. The day had been as
harsh as a shining, splintery plank. The night was
like a gray silk pillow. In blissful, soothing consciousness
of perfect comfort every one in the
boarding-house climbed up on the roof to watch the
gorgeous, fearful conflagration across the city. The
Landlady's voice piped high and shrill discussing the
value of insurance. The Old Maids scuttled together
under their knitted shawls. The Much-Loved
Girl sat amiably enthroned among the bachelors
with one man's coat across her shoulders, another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
man's cap on her yellow head, and two deliciously
timid hands clutched at the coat-sleeves
of the two men nearest her. Whenever she bent
her head she trailed the fluff of her hair across the
enraptured eyelids of the Poet.</p>

<p>Only Noreen Gaudette was missing.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Gaudette?" probed the Political
Economist.</p>

<p>The Masseuse answered vehemently: "Why,
Noreen's getting ready to go to the fire. Her paper
sent for her just as we came up. There's an awful
row on, you know, about the inefficiency of the Fire
Department, and there's no other person in all the
city who can make people look as silly as Noreen
can. If this thing appeals to her to-night, and she
gets good and mad enough, and keeps her nerve,
there'll be the biggest overhauling of the Fire Department
that <i>you</i> ever saw! But I'm sorry it
happened. It will be an all-night job, and Noreen
is almost dead enough as it is."</p>

<p>"An 'all-night job'?" The Much-Loved Girl
gasped out her startled sense of propriety, and snuggled
back against the shoulder of the man who sat
nearest to her. She was very genuinely sorry for
any one who had to be improper.</p>

<p>The Political Economist, noting the incident in
its entirety, turned abruptly on his heel, climbed
down the tremulous ladder to the trunk-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
floor and knocked peremptorily at Noreen's
door.</p>

<p>In reply to the answer which he thought he heard,
he turned the handle of the door and entered. The
gas jet sizzled blatantly across the room, and a tiny
blue flame toiled laboriously in a cooking lamp beneath
a pot of water. The room was reeking strong
with the smell of coffee, the rank brew that wafted
him back in nervous terror to his college days and
the ghastly eve of his final examinations. A coat,
a hat, a mouse-gray sweater, a sketch-book, and a
bunch of pencils were thrown together on the edge
of the divan. Crouched on the floor with head and
shoulders prostrate across her easel chair and thin
hands straining at the woodwork was Noreen
Gaudette. The startled face that lifted to his was
haggard with the energy of a year rallied to the
needs of an hour.</p>

<p>"I thought you told me to come in," said the Political
Economist. "I came down to go to the fire
with you."</p>

<p>Noreen was on her feet in an instant, hurrying
into her hat and coat, and quaffing greedily at the
reeking coffee.</p>

<p>"You ought to have some one to look after you,"
persisted the man. "Where's Mr. Dextwood?"</p>

<p>Noreen stood still in the middle of the floor and
stared at him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I've broken my engagement," she exclaimed,
trying hard to speak tamely and reserve
every possible fraction of her artificial energy.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she smiled wanly, "I couldn't afford
to be engaged! I couldn't afford the time. I
couldn't afford the money. I couldn't afford the
mental distraction. I'm working again now, but
it's horribly hard to get back into the mood. My
drawing has all gone to smash. But I'll get the
hang of it again pretty soon."</p>

<p>"You look in mighty poor shape to work to-night,"
said the Political Economist. "What
makes you go?"</p>

<p>"What makes me go?" cried Noreen, with an
extravagant burst of vehemence. "What makes
me go?&mdash;Why, if I make good to-night on those
Fire-Department Pictures I get a Hundred Dollars,
as well as the assurance of all the Republican cartooning
for the next city election. It's worth a lot
of money to me!"</p>

<p>"Enough to kill yourself for?" probed the Man.</p>

<p>Noreen's mouth began to twist. "Yes&mdash;if you
still owe for your automobile coat, and your black
evening gown, and your room rent and a few other
trifles of that sort. But come on, if you'll promise
not to talk to me till it's all over." Like a pair of
youngsters they scurried down the stairs, jumped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
into the waiting cab, and galloped off toward the
river edge of the city.</p>

<p>True to his promise, the Political Economist did
not speak to her, but he certainly had not promised
to keep his eyes shut as well as his mouth. From
the very first she sat far forward on the seat where
the passing street-lights blazed upon her unconscious
face. The Man, the cab, love-making, debt-paying,
all were forgotten in her desperate effort to keep
keyed up to the working-point. Her brain was
hurriedly sketching in her backgrounds. Her suddenly
narrowed eyes foretold the tingling pride in
some particular imagining. The flashing twist of
her smile predicted the touch of malice that was to
make her pictures the sensation of&mdash;a day.</p>

<p>The finish of the three-mile drive found her jubilant,
prescient, pulsing with power. The glow from
the flames lit up the cab like a room. The engine
bells clanged around them. Sparks glittered.
Steam hissed. When the cabman's horse refused to
scorch his nose any nearer the conflagration, Noreen
turned to the Political Economist with some embarrassment.
"If you really want to help me," she
pleaded, "you'll stay here in the cab and wait for
me."</p>

<p>Then, before the Political Economist could offer
his angry protest, she had opened the door, jumped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
from the step, and disappeared into the surging,
rowdy throng of spectators. A tedious hour later
the cab door opened abruptly, and Noreen reappeared.</p>

<p>Her hat was slouched down over her heat-scorched
eyes. Her shoulders were limp. Her
face was dull, dumb, gray, like a Japanese lantern
robbed of its candle. Bluntly she thrust her sketch-book
into his hands and threw herself down on the
seat beside him.</p>

<p>"Oh, take me home," she begged. "Oh, take
me home <i>quick</i>. It's no use," she added with a
shrug, "I've seen the whole performance. I've
been everywhere&mdash;inside the ropes&mdash;up on the
roofs&mdash;out on the waterfront. The Fire Department
Men are not 'inefficient.' They're simply
<i>bully!</i> <i>And I make no caricatures of heroes!</i>"</p>

<p>The lurch of the cab wheel against a curbstone
jerked a faint smile into her face. "Isn't it horrid,"
she complained, "to have a Talent and a Living
that depend altogether upon your <i>getting
mad?</i>" Then her eyes flooded with worry.
"What <i>shall</i> I do?"</p>

<p>"You'll marry me," said the Political Economist.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" gasped Noreen. "I shall never,
never marry any one! I told you that I couldn't
afford to be engaged. It takes too much time, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
besides," her color flamed piteously, "I didn't like
being engaged."</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you to be engaged," persisted the
Political Economist. "I didn't ask you to serve
any underpaid, ill-fed, half-hearted apprenticeship
to Happiness. I asked you to be married."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" sighed Noreen. "I shall never
marry any one."</p>

<p>The Political Economist began to laugh. "Going
to be an old maid?" he teased.</p>

<p>The high lights flamed into Noreen's eyes. She
braced herself into the corner of the carriage and
fairly hurled her defiance at him. Indomitable purpose
raged in her heart, unutterable pathos drooped
around her lips. Every atom of blood in her body
was working instantly in her brain. No single drop
of it loafed in her cheeks under the flimsy guise of
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I am not an 'Old Maid!' I am not! No one
who creates anything is an 'Old Maid'!"</p>

<p>The passion of her mood broke suddenly into
wilful laughter. She shook her head at him
threateningly.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever dare to call me an 'Old Maid'
again.&mdash;But I'll tell you just what you can call
me&mdash;Women are supposed to be the Poetry of
Life, aren't they&mdash;the Sonnet, the Lyric, the
Limerick? Well&mdash;I am blank verse. <i>That</i> is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the trouble with me. I simply <i>do not rhyme</i>.&mdash;That
is all!"</p>

<p>"Will you marry me?" persisted the Political
Economist.</p>

<p>Noreen shook her head. "No!" she repeated.
"You don't seem to understand. Marriage is not
for me. I tell you that I am Blank Verse. I am
<i>Talent</i>, and I do not <i>rhyme</i> with Love. I am <i>Talent</i>
and I do not rhyme with <i>Man</i>. There is no place
in my life for you. You can not come into my
verse and rhyme with me!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you a little bit exclusive?" goaded the
Political Economist.</p>

<p>Noreen nodded gravely. "Yes," she said, "I
am brutally exclusive. But everybody isn't. Life
is so easy for some women. Now, the Much-Loved
Girl is nothing in the world except 'Miss.' She
rhymes inevitably with almost anybody's kiss.&mdash;<i>I</i>
am not just '<i>Miss</i>.' The Much-Loved Girl is nothing
in the world except 'Girl.'&mdash;She rhymes inevitably
with 'Curl.' <i>I</i> am not just '<i>Girl</i>.' She
is 'Coy' and rhymes with 'Boy.' She is 'Simple'
and rhymes with 'Dimple.' <i>I am none of those
things!</i> I haven't the Lure of the Sonnet. I
haven't the Charm of the Lyric. I haven't the
Bait of the Limerick. At the very best I am
'Brain' and rhyme with 'Pain.' And I wish I
was <i>dead!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The Political Economist's heart was pounding
like a gong smothered in velvet. But he stooped
over very quietly and pushed the floor cushion under
her feet and snuggled the mouse-gray sweater into
a pillowed roll behind her aching neck. Then from
his own remotest corner he reached out casually and
rallied her limp, cold hand into the firm, warm clasp
of his vibrant fingers.</p>

<p>"Of course, you never have rhymed," he said.
"How could you possibly have rhymed when&mdash;<i>I
am the missing lines of your verse?</i>" His clasp
tightened. "Never mind about Poetry to-night,
Dear, but <i>to-morrow</i> we'll take your little incomplete
lonesome verse and quicken it into a Love-Song
that will make the Oldest Angel in Heaven
sit up and carol!"</p>

<h2>THE HAPPY-DAY</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 163px;">
<img src="images/drop_i.png" width="163" height="164" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />T was not you, yourself, who invented
your Happy-day. It was
your Father, long ago in little-lad
time, when a Happy-Day or
a Wooden Soldier or High Heaven
itself lay equally tame and giftable
in the cuddling, curving hollow of a Father's
hand.</div>

<p>Your Father must have been a very great Genius.
How else could he have invented any happy
thing in the black-oak library?</p>

<p>The black-oak library was a cross-looking room,
dingy, lowering, and altogether boggy. You could
not stamp your boot across the threshold without
joggling the heart-beats out of the gaunt old clock
that loomed in the darkermost corner of the alcove.
You could not tiptoe to the candy box without
plunging headlong into a stratum of creakiness that
puckered your spine as though an electric devil
were pulling the very last basting thread out of
your little soul. Oh, it must have been a very,
very aged room. The darkness was abhorrent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
you. The dampness reeked with the stale, sad
breath of ancient storms. Worst of all, blood-red
curtains clotted at the windows; rusty swords and
daggers hung most imminently from the walls, and
along the smutted hearth a huge, moth-eaten tiger
skin humped up its head in really terrible ferocity.</p>

<p>Through all the room there was no lively spot
except the fireplace itself.</p>

<p>Usually, white birch logs flamed on the hearth
with pleasant, crackling cheerfulness, but on this
special day you noted with alarm that between the
gleaming andirons a soft, red-leather book writhed
and bubbled with little gray wisps of pain, while
out of a charry, smoochy mass of nothingness a
blue-flowered muslin sleeve stretched pleadingly toward
you for an instant, shuddered, blazed, and
was&mdash;gone.</p>

<p>It was there that your Father caught you, with
that funny, strange sniff of havoc in your nostrils.</p>

<p>It was there that your Father told you his news.</p>

<p>When you are only a little, little boy and your
Father snatches you suddenly up in his arms and
tells you that he is going to be married again, it is
very astonishing. You had always supposed that
your Father was perfectly married! In the dazzling
sunshine of the village church was there not
a thrilly blue window that said quite distinctly,
"Clarice Val Dere" (that was your Mother)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
"Lived" (<i>Lived</i>, it said!) "June, 1860&mdash;December,
1880"? All the other windows said "Died"
on them. Why should your Father marry again?</p>

<p>In your Dear Father's arms you gasped, "Going
to be <i>married?</i>" and your two eyes must have
popped right out of your head, for your Father
stooped down very suddenly and kissed them hard&mdash;whack,
whack, back into place.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o, not going to be married," he corrected,
"but going to be married&mdash;again."</p>

<p>He spoke as though there were a great difference;
but it was man-talk and you did not understand
it.</p>

<p>Then he gathered you into the big, dark chair
and pushed you way out on his knees and scrunched
your cheeks in his hands and ate your face all up
with his big eyes. When he spoke at last, his voice
was way down deep like a bass drum.</p>

<p>"Little Boy Jack," he said, "you must never,
never, never forget your Dear Mother!"</p>

<p>His words and the bir-r-r of them shook you like
a leaf.</p>

<p>"But what was my Dear Mother like?" you
whimpered. You had never seen your Mother.</p>

<p>Then your Father jumped up and walked hard
on the creaky floor. When he turned round again,
his eyes were all wet and shiny like a brown stained-glass
window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was your Dear Mother like?" he repeated.
"Your Dear Mother was like&mdash;was like&mdash;the
flash of a white wing across a stormy sea.
And your Dear Mother's name was 'Clarice.' I
give it to you for a Memorial. What better Memorial
could a little boy have than his Dear Mother's
name? And there is a date&mdash;" His voice
grew suddenly harsh and hard like iron, and his
lips puckered on his words as with a taste of rust&mdash;"there
is a date&mdash;the 26th of April&mdash;No,
that is too hard a date for a little boy's memory!
It was a Thursday. I give you Thursday for your&mdash;Happy-Day.
'Clarice' for a Memorial, and
Thursday for your Happy-Day." His words began
to beat on you like blows. "As&mdash;long&mdash;as&mdash;you&mdash;live,"
he cried, "be very kind to any one
who is named 'Clarice.' And no matter what Time
brings you&mdash;weeks, months, years, centuries&mdash;<i>keep
Thursday for your Happy-Day</i>. No cruelty
must ever defame it, no malice, no gross bitterness."</p>

<p>Then he crushed you close to him for the millionth,
billionth fraction of a second, and went
away, while you stayed behind in the scary black-oak
library, feeling as big and achy and responsible
as you used to feel when you and your Dear
Father were carrying a heavy suit-case together
and your Dear Father let go his share just a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to light his brown cigar. It gave you a beautiful
feeling in your head, but way off in your stomach
it tugged some.</p>

<p>So you crept away to bed at last, and dreamed
that on a shining path leading straight from your
front door to Heaven you had to carry all alone two
perfectly huge suit-cases packed tight with love,
and one of the suit-cases was marked "Clarice"
and one was marked "Thursday." Tug, tug, tug,
you went, and stumble, stumble, stumble, but your
Dear Father could not help you at all because he
was perfectly busy carrying a fat leather bag, some
golf sticks, and a bull-terrier for a strange lady.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant dream, and you screamed
out so loud in the night that the Housekeeper-Woman
had to come and comfort you. It was
the Housekeeper-Woman who told you that on the
morrow your Father was going far off across the
salt seas. It was the Housekeeper-Woman who
told you that you, yourself, were to be given away
to a Grandmother-Lady in Massachusetts. It was
also the Housekeeper-Woman who told you that
your puppy dog Bruno&mdash;Bruno the big, the black,
the curly, the waggy, was not to be included in the
family gift to the Grandmother-Lady. Everybody
reasoned, it seemed, that you would not need Bruno
because there would be so many other dogs in Massachusetts.
That was just the trouble. They <i>would</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
all be "other dogs." It was Bruno that you
wanted, for he was the only <i>dog</i>, just as <i>you</i> were
the only <i>boy</i> in the world. All the rest were only
"other boys." You could have explained the matter
perfectly to your Father if the Housekeeper-Woman
had not made you cry so that you broke
your explainer. But later in the night the most
beautiful thought came to you. At first perhaps
it tasted a little bit sly in your mouth, but after a
second it spread like ginger, warm and sweet over
your whole body except your toes, and you crept
out of bed like a flannel ghost and fumbled your
way down the black hall to your Dear Father's
room and woke him shamelessly from his sleep.
His eyes in the moonlight gleamed like two frightened
dreams.</p>

<p>"Dear Father," you cried&mdash;you could hardly
get the words fast enough out of your mouth&mdash;"Dear&mdash;Father&mdash;I&mdash;do&mdash;not&mdash;think&mdash;Bruno&mdash;is&mdash;a&mdash;very&mdash;good&mdash;name&mdash;for&mdash;a&mdash;big&mdash;black&mdash;dog&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;name&mdash;him&mdash;Clarice&mdash;instead!"</p>

<p>That was how you and Bruno-Clarice happened
to celebrate together your first Happy-Day with a
long, magic, joggling train journey to Massachusetts&mdash;the
only original <i>boy</i> and the only original
<i>dog</i> in all the world.</p>

<p>The Grandmother-Lady proved to be a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
pleasant purple sort of person. Exactly whose
Grandmother she was, you never found out. She
was not your Father's mother. She was not your
Mother's mother. With these links missing, whose
Grandmother could she be? You could hardly
press the matter further without subjecting her to
the possible mortification of confessing that she was
only adopted. Maybe, crudest of all, she was just
a Paid-Grandmother.</p>

<p>The Grandmother-Lady lived in a perfectly
brown house in a perfectly green garden on the
edge of a perfectly blue ocean. That was the
Sight of it. Salted mignonette was the Smell of
it. And a fresh wind flapping through tall poplar
trees was always and forever the Sound of it.</p>

<p>The brown house itself was the living image of
a prim, old-fashioned bureau backed up bleakly to
the street, with its piazza side yanked out boldly
into the garden like a riotous bureau drawer,
through which the Rising Sun rummaged every
morning for some particular new shade of scarlet
or yellow nasturtiums. As though quite shocked
by such bizarre untidiness, the green garden ran
tattling like mad down to the ocean and was most
frantically shooed back again, so that its little trees
and shrubs and flowers fluttered in a perpetual nervous
panic of not knowing which way to blow.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs03.jpg" width="400" height="352" alt="The blue ocean was the most wonderful thing of all" title="" />
<span class="caption">The blue ocean was the most wonderful thing of all</span>
</div>

<p>But the blue ocean was the most wonderful thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of all. Never was there such an ocean! Right
from the far-away edge of the sky it came, roaring,
ranting, rumpling, till it broke against the beach
all white and frilly like the Grandmother-Lady's
best ruching. It was morning when you saw the
ocean first, and its pleasant waters gleamed like
a gorgeous, bright-blue looking-glass covered with
paper ships all filled with Other Boys' fathers. It
was not till the first night came down&mdash;black and
mournful and moany&mdash;it was not till the first
night came down that you saw that the ocean was
Much Too Large. There in your chill linen bed,
with the fear of Sea and Night and Strangers upon
you, you discovered a very strange droll thing&mdash;that
your Father was a Person and might therefore
leave you, but that your Mother was a <i>feeling</i>
and would never, never, never forsake you. Bruno-Clarice,
slapping his fat, black tail against your
bedroom floor, was something of a <i>feeling</i> too.</p>

<p>Most fortunately for your well-being, the Grandmother-Lady's
house was not too isolated from its
neighbors. To be sure, a tall, stiff hedge separated
the green garden from the lavender-and-pink
garden next door, but a great scraggly hole in the
hedge gave a beautiful prickly zest to friendly communication.</p>

<p>More than this, two children lived on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
side of the hedge. You had never had any playmates
before in all your life!</p>

<p>One of the children was just Another Boy&mdash;a
duplicate of you. But the other one was&mdash;<i>the
only original girl</i>. Next to the big ocean, she was
the surprise of your life. She wore skirts instead
of clothes. She wore curls instead of hair. She
wore stockings instead of legs. She cried when
you laughed. She laughed when you cried. She
was funny from the very first second, even when
the Boy asked you if your big dog would bite.
The Boy stood off and kept right on asking:
"Will he bite? Will he bite? <i>W-i-l-l</i> he <i>bite?</i>"
But the Girl took a great rough stick and pried
open Bruno-Clarice's tusky mouth <i>to see if he
would</i>, and when he <i>g-r-o-w-l-e-d</i>, she just kissed
him smack on his black nose and called him "A
Precious," and said, "Why, of course he'll bite."</p>

<p>The Boy was ten years old&mdash;a year older, and
much fatter than you. His name was Sam. The
Girl was only eight years old, and you could not
tell at first whether she was thin or fat, she was
so ruffledy. She had a horrid dressy name,
"Sophia." But everybody called her Ladykin.</p>

<p>Oh, it is fun to make a boat that will flop sideways
through the waves. It is fun to make a windmill
that will whirl and whirl in the grass. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
fun to make an education. It is fun to make a
fortune. But most of anything in the world it is
fun to make a <i>friend!</i></p>

<p>You had never made a <i>friend</i> before. First of
all you asked, "How old are you?" "Can you
do fractions?" "Can you name the capes on the
west coast of Africa?" "What is your favorite
color? Green? Blue? Pink? Red? Or yellow?"
Sam voted for green. Ladykin chose
green <i>and</i> blue <i>and</i> pink <i>and</i> red <i>and</i> yellow, <i>also</i>
purple. Then you asked, "Which are you most
afraid of, the Judgment Day or a Submarine
Boat?" Sam chose the Submarine Boat right off,
so you had to take the Judgment Day, which was
not a very pleasant fear to have for a pet. Ladykin
declared that she wasn't afraid of anything in
the world except of Being Homely. Wasn't that
a silly fear? Then you got a little more intimate
and asked, "What is your Father's business?"
Sam and Ladykin's Father kept a huge candy store.
It was mortifying to have to confess that your Father
was only an Artist, but you laid great stress on
his large eyes and his long fingers.</p>

<p>Then you three went off to the sandy beach and
climbed up on a great huddly gray rock to watch
the huge yellow sun go down all shiny and important,
like a twenty-dollar gold piece in a wad
of pink cotton batting. The tide was going out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
too, the mean old "injun-giver," taking back all
the pretty, chuckling pebbles, the shining ropes of
seaweed, the dear salt secrets it had brought so
teasingly to your feet a few hours earlier. You
were very lonesome. But not till the gold and pink
was almost gone from the sky did you screw your
courage up to its supreme point. First you threw
four stones very far out into the surf, then&mdash;</p>

<p>"What&mdash;is&mdash;your&mdash;Mother&mdash;like?" you
whispered.</p>

<p>Ladykin went to her answer with impetuous certainty:</p>

<p>"Our Mother," she announced, "is fat and short
and wears skin-tight dresses, and is President of
the Woman's Club, and is sometimes cross."</p>

<p>A great glory came upon you and you clutched
for wonder at the choking neck of your little blouse.</p>

<p>"M-y Mother," you said, "m-y Mother is like
the Flash of a White Wing across a Stormy
Sea!"</p>

<p>You started to say more, but with a wild war-whoop
of amusement, Sam lost his balance and fell
sprawling into the sand. "Oh, what a funny
Mother!" he shouted, but Ladykin jumped down
on him furiously and began to kick him with her
scarlet sandals. "Hush! hush!" she cried, "Jack's
Mother is dead!" and then in an instant she had
clambered back to your side again and snuggled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
her little soft girl-cheek close against yours, while
with one tremulous hand she pointed way out beyond
the surf line where a solitary, snow-white gull
swooped down into the Blue. "Look!" she gasped,
"L-o-o-k!" and when you turned to her with a
sudden gulping sob, she kissed you warm and sweet
upon your lips.</p>

<p>It was not a Father kiss with two tight arms and
a scrunching pain. It was not a Grandmother-Lady
kiss complimenting your clean face. It was
not a Bruno-Clarice kiss, mute and wistful and
lappy. There was no pain in it. There was no
compliment. There was no doggish fealty. There
was just <i>sweetness</i>.</p>

<p>Then you looked straight at Ladykin, and Ladykin
looked straight at you, looked and <i>looked</i> and
LOOKED, and you both gasped right out loud
before the first miracle of your life, the Miracle of
the Mating of Thoughts. Without a word of suggestion,
without a word of explanation, you and
Ladykin clasped hands and tiptoed stealthily off to
the very edge of the water, and knelt down slushily
in the sand, and stooped way over, oh, way, way
over, with the cold waves squirting up your cuffs;
and kissed two perfectly round floaty kisses out to
the White Sea-Gull, and after a minute the White
Gull rose in the sky, swirled round and round and
round, stopped for a second, and then with a wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
cry swooped down again into the blue&mdash;Once!
Twice! and then with a great fountainy splash of
wings rose high in the air like a white silk kite and
went scudding off like mad into the Grayness, then
into the Blackness, then into the Nothingness of the
night. And you stayed behind on that pleasant,
safe, sandy edge of things with all the sweetness
gone from your lips, and nothing left you in all
the world but the thudding of your heart, and a
queer, sad, salty pucker on your tongue that gave
you a thirst not so much for water as for <i>life</i>.</p>

<p>Oh, you learned a great deal about living in those
first few days and weeks and months at the Grandmother-Lady's
house.</p>

<p>You learned, for instance, that if you wanted to
<i>do</i> things, Boys were best; but if you wanted to
<i>think</i> things, then Girls were infinitely superior.
You, yourself, were part Thinker and part Doer.</p>

<p>Sam was a <i>doer</i> from start to finish, strong of
limb, long of wind, sturdy of purpose. But Sam
was certainly prosy in his head. Ladykin, on the
contrary, had "gray matter" that jumped like a
squirrel in its cage, and fled hither and yon, and
turned somersaults, and leaped through hoops, and
was altogether alert beyond description. But she
could not <i>do</i> things. She could not stay in the nice
ocean five minutes without turning blue. She
could not climb a tree without falling and bumping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
her nose. She could not fight without getting mad.
Out of these proven facts you evolved a beautiful
theory that if Thinky-Girls could only be taught to
<i>do</i> things, they would make the most perfect playmates
in all the wide, wide world. Yet somehow
you never made a theory to improve Sam, though
Sam's inability to think invariably filled you with
a very cross, unholy contempt for him, while Ladykin's
inability to <i>do</i> only served to thrill you with the
most delicious, sweet, puffy pride in <i>yourself</i>.</p>

<p>Sam was very evidently a Person. Ladykin was
a Feeling. You began almost at once to distinguish
between Persons and Feelings. Anything
that straightened out your head was a Person.
Anything that puckered up your heart was a Feeling.
Your Father, you had found out, was a Person.
The Grandmother-Lady was a Person. Sam
was a Person. Sunshine was a Person. A Horse
was a Person. A Chrysanthemum was a Person.
But your Mother was a Feeling. And Ladykin was
a Feeling. And Bruno-Clarice was a Feeling.
And the Ocean Blue was a Feeling. And a Church
Organ was a Feeling. And the Smell of a June
Rose was a Feeling. Perhaps your Happy-Day
was the biggest Feeling of All.</p>

<p>Thursday, to be sure, came only once a week, but&mdash;<i>such
a Thursday!</i> Even now, if you shut your
eyes tight and gasp a quick breath, you can sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
once more the sweet, crisp joy of fresh, starched
clothes, and the pleasant, shiny jingle of new pennies
in your small white cotton pockets. White?
Yes; your Father had said that always on that
day you should go like a little white Flag of Truce
on an embassy to Fate. And Happiness? Could
anything in the world make more for happiness
than to be perfectly clean in the morning and perfectly
dirty at night, with something rather frisky
to eat for dinner, and Sam and Ladykin invariably
invited to supper? Your Happy-Day was your
Sacristy, too. Nobody ever punished you on
Thursday. Nobody was ever cross to you on
Thursday. Even if you were very black-bad the
last thing Wednesday night, you were perfectly,
blissfully, lusciously safe until Friday morning.</p>

<p>Oh, a Happy-Day was a very simple thing to
manage compared with the terrible difficulties of
being kind to everybody named "Clarice." There
was <i>nobody</i> named Clarice! In all the town, in
all the directory, in all the telephone books, you
and Ladykin could not find a single person named
Clarice. Once in a New York newspaper you read
about a young Clarice-Lady of such and such a
street who fell and broke her hip; and you took
twenty shiny pennies of your money and bought a
beautiful, hand-painted celluloid brush-holder and
sent it to her; but you never, never heard that it did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
her any good. You did not want your Father to be
mad at you, but Ladykin reasoned you out of your
possible worry by showing you how if you ever saw
your Father again you could at least plant your
feet firmly, fold your arms, puff out your chest, and
affirm distinctly: "Dear Father, I have <i>never</i>
been cruel to <i>any one</i> named 'Clarice.'" Ladykin
knew perfectly well how to manage it. Ladykin
knew perfectly well how to manage everything.</p>

<p>Sam was the stupid one. Sam took a certain
pleasure in Bruno-Clarice, but he never realized
that Bruno-Clarice was a sacred dog. Sam thought
that it was very fine for you to have a Happy-Day,
with Clean Clothes, and Ice-Cream, and Pennies,
but he never almost <i>burst</i> with the wonder of the
day.</p>

<p>Sam thought that it was pleasant enough for you
to have a dead Mother who was like "the flash of
a white wing across a stormy sea," but he did
not see any possible connection between that
fact and stoning all the white sea-gulls in sight.
Ladykin, on the contrary, told Sam distinctly that
she'd knock his head off if he ever hit a gull, but
fortunately&mdash;or unfortunately&mdash;Ladykin's aim
was not so sure as Sam's. It was you who had to
stay behind on the beach and pommel more than
half the life out of Sam while Ladykin, pink as a
posy in her best muslin, scared to death of wet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cold, plunged out to her little neck in the chopping
waves to rescue a quivering fluff of feathers that
struggled broken-winged against the cruel, drowning
water. "Gulls are gulls!" persisted Sam with
every blubbering breath. "Gulls are <i>Mothers!</i>"
gasped Ladykin, staggering from the surf all
drenched and dripping like a bursted water-pail.
"Well, boy-gulls are gulls!" Sam screamed in a
perfect explosion of outraged <i>truth</i>. But Ladykin
defied him to the last. Through chattering teeth
her vehement reassertion sounded like some horrid,
wicked blasphemy: "Nnnnnnnnnnnn-oo! Bbb-o-y
ggggg-ggulls are MMMMMM-Mothers too!"
Then with that pulsing drench of feathers cuddled
close to her breast, she struggled off alone to the
house to have the Croup, while you and Sam went
cheerily up the beach to find some shiners and some
seaweed for your new gull hospital. Not till you
were quite an old boy did you ever find out what
became of that gull. Sacred Bruno-Clarice ate
him. Ladykin, it seems, knew always what had
happened to him, but she never dreamed of telling
you till you were old enough to bear it. To Ladykin,
Truth out of season was sourer than strawberries
at Christmas time.</p>

<p>Sam would have told you <i>anything</i> the very first
second that he found it out. Sam was perfectly
great for Truth. He could tell more Great Black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Truths in one day than there were thunder-clouds
in the whole hot summer sky. This quality made
Sam just a little bit dangerous in a crowd. He was
always and forever shooting people with Truths
that he didn't know were loaded. He was always
telling the Grandmother-Lady, for instance, that her
hair looked <i>exactly</i> like a wig. He was always telling
Ladykin that she smelled of raspberry jam.
He was always telling you that he didn't believe
your Father really loved you. Oh, everything that
Sam said was as straight and lank and honest as a
lady's hair when it's out of crimp. Nothing in the
world could be straighter than that.</p>

<p>But sometimes, when you had played sturdily
with Sam for a good many hours, you used to coax
Ladykin off all alone to the puffy, scorchy-looking
smoke tree, where you could cuddle up on the rustic
seat and rest your Honesty. And when you were
thoroughly rested, you used to stretch your little
arms behind your yawning face and beg:</p>

<p>"Oh, Ladykin, wouldn't you, couldn't you
<i>please</i> say something curly?"</p>

<p>Ladykin's mind seemed to curl perfectly naturally.
The crimp of it never came out. Almost
any time you could take her words that looked so
little and tight, and unwind them and unwind them
into yards and yards and yards of pleasant, magic
meanings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no magic meanings in Sam's words.
Sam, for instance, could throw as many as a hundred
stones into the water, yet when he got through
he just lay down in the sand and groaned, "Oh,
how tired I am! Oh, how tired I am!" But Ladykin,
after she'd thrown only two stones&mdash;one that
hit the beach, and one that hit you&mdash;would stand
right up and declare that her arm was "<i>be</i>-witched."
Tired? No, not a bit of it, but "<i>be</i>-witched!"
Hadn't she seen, hadn't you seen, hadn't everybody
seen that <i>perfectly awful</i> sea-witch's head that
popped out of the wave just after she had thrown
her first stone? Oh, indeed, and it wasn't the first
time either that she had been so frightened! Once
when she was sitting on the sand counting sea-shells,
hadn't the Witch swooped right out of the water
and grabbed her legs? So, now if you wanted to
break the cruel spell, save Ladykin's life, marry
Ladykin, and live in a solid turquoise palace&mdash;where
all the walls were papered with foreign postage-stamps,
and no duplicates&mdash;you, not Sam, but
<i>you</i>, <i>you</i>, chosen of all the world, must go down to
the little harbor between the two highest, reariest
rocks and stick a spiked stick through every wave
that came in. There was no other way! Now
you, yourself, might possibly have invented the
witch, but you never, never would have thought of
harpooning the waves and falling in and drowning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
your best suit, while Ladykin rested her
arms.</p>

<p>Yet in the enforced punishment of an early bedtime
you were not bereaved, but lay in rapturous
delight untangling the minutest detail of Ladykin's
words, till turquoise cities blazed like a turquoise
flashlight across your startled senses, wonderful little
princes and princesses kowtowed perpetually to
royal Mother Ladykin and royal Father Yourself,
and life-sized postage-stamps loomed so lusciously
large that envelopes had to be pasted to the corners
of stamps instead of stamps to the corners of envelopes.
And before you had half straightened out
the whole thought, you were fast asleep, and then
fast awake, and it was suddenly morning! Oh, it
is very comforting to have a playmate who can say
curly things.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, when Sam's and Ladykin's
Mother had been rude to them about brushing
their teeth or tracking perfectly good mud into
the parlor, and Sam had gone off to ease his
sorrow, scating hens or stoning cats, you and
Ladykin would steal down to the gray rock on the
beach to watch the white, soft, pleasant sea-gulls.
There were times, you think, when Ladykin
wished that <i>her</i> Mother was a sea-gull. Then you
used to wonder and wonder about your own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Mother, and tell Ladykin all over again about
the creaky, black-oak library, and the smoky,
smelly hearth-fire with the hurt red book, and
the blue-flowered muslin sleeve beckoning and
beckoning to you; and Ladykin used to explain
to you how, very evidently, you were
the only souvenir that your Father did not burn.
With that thought in mind, you used to try and
guess what could possibly have happened long ago
on a Thursday to make a Happy-Day forever and
ever. Ladykin said that of course it was something
about "Love," but when you ran off to ask the
Grandmother-Lady just exactly what Love was,
the Grandmother-Lady only laughed and said
that Love was a fever that came along a few
years after chicken-pox and measles and scarlet
fever. Ladykin was saucy about it. "That may
be <i>true</i>," Ladykin acknowledged, "but <i>t'aint so!</i>"
Then you went and found Sam and asked him if
he knew what Love was. Sam knew at once.
Sam said that Love was the feeling that one
had for mathematics. Now that was all <i>bosh</i>, for
the feeling that you and Ladykin had for Mathematics
would not have made a Happy-Day for a
cow.</p>

<p>But even if there were a great many things that
you could not find out, it was a good deal of fun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to grow up. Apart from a few stomach-aches and
two or three gnawing pains in the calves of your
legs, aging was a most alluring process.</p>

<p>Springs, summers, autumns, winters, went hurtling
over one another, till all of a sudden, without
the slightest effort on your part, you were fifteen
years old, Bruno-Clarice had grown to be a sober,
industrious, middle-aged dog, Sam was idolatrously
addicted to geometry, and Ladykin subscribed to a
fashion magazine for the benefit of her paper dolls.</p>

<p>Most astonishing of all, however, your Father
had invited you to go to Germany and visit him.
It was a glorious invitation. You were all athrill
with the geography and love of it. Already your
nostrils crinkled to the lure of tar and oakum. Already
your vision feasted on the parrot-colored
crowds of Come-igrants and Go-igrants that huddled
along the wharves with their eager, jabbering
faces and their soggy, wadded feet.</p>

<p>Oh, the prospect of the journey was a most beautiful
experience, but when the actual Eve of Departure
came, the scissors of separation gleamed
rather hard and sharp in the air, and you hunched
your neck a little bit wincingly before the final
crunching snip. That last evening was a dreadful
evening. The Cook sat sobbing in the kitchen.
The Grandmother-Lady's eyes were red with sewing.
The air was all heavy with <i>goingawayness</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
To escape the strangle of it, you fled to the beach
with Bruno-Clarice tagging in mournful excitement
at your heels, his smutty nose all a-sniff with
the foreboding leathery smell of trunks and bags.
There on the beach in a scoopy hollow of sand
backed up against the old gray rock were Sam and
Ladykin. Sam's round, fat face was fretted like
a pug-dog's, and Ladykin's eyes were blinky-wet
with tears.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant time to say good-by. It
had been a beautiful, smooth-skied day, crisp and
fresh and bright-colored as a "Sunday supplement";
but now the clouds piled gray and crumpled
in the west like a poor stale, thrown-away
newspaper, with just a sputtering blaze in one corner
like the kindling of a half-hearted match.</p>

<p>"<i>Please</i> be kind to Bruno-Clarice," you began;
"I shall miss you very much&mdash;very, very much.
But I will come back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o, I do not think you will come back,"
said Ladykin. "You will go to Germany to live
with your Father and your Play-Mother, and you
will gargle all your words like a throat tonic till
you don't know how to be friends in English any
more; and even if you did come back Bruno-Clarice
would bark at you, and I shall be married, and Sam
will have a long, black beard."</p>

<p>Now you could have borne Ladykin's marriage;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
you could even have borne Bruno-Clarice's barking
at you; but you could not, simply could not bear the
thought of Sam's growing a long black beard without
you. Even Ladykin with all her wonderfulness
sat utterly helpless before the terrible, unexpected
climax of her words. It was Sam who
leaped into the breach. The clutch of his hand
was like the grit of sand-paper. "Jack," he stammered,
"Jack, I promise you&mdash;anyhow I won't
<i>cut</i> my beard until you come!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was certainly only the thought of Sam's faithful
beard that sustained you on your rough, blue
voyage to Germany. It was certainly only the
thought of Sam's faithful beard that rallied your
smitten forces when you met your Father face to
face and saw him reel back white as chalk against
the silky shoulder of your Play-Mother, and hide
his eyes behind the crook of his elbow.</p>

<p>It is not pleasant to make people turn white as
chalk, even in Germany. Worse yet, every day
your Father grew whiter and whiter and whiter,
and every day your pretty Play-Mother wrinkled
her forehead more and more in a strange, hurty
sort of trouble. Never once did you dare think of
Ladykin. Never once did you dare think of Bruno-Clarice.
You just named all your upper teeth
"Sam," and all your lower teeth "Sam," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ground them into each other all day long&mdash;"Sam!
Sam! Sam!" over and over and over. There were
also no Happy-Days in Germany, and nobody ever
spoke of Clarice.</p>

<p>You were pretty glad at last after a month when
your Father came to you with his most beautiful
face and his most loving hands, and said:</p>

<p>"Little Boy Jack, there is no use in it. You
have got to go away again. You are a wound that
will not heal. It is your Dear Mother's eyes. It
is your Dear Mother's mouth. It is your Dear
Mother's smile. God forgive me, but I cannot bear
it! I am going to send you away to school in England."</p>

<p>You put your finger cautiously up to your eyes
and traced their round, firm contour. Your
Mother's eyes? They felt like two heaping teaspoonfuls
of tears. Your Mother's mouth? Desperately
you poked it into a smile. "Going to
send me away to school in England?" you stammered.
"Never mind. Sam will not cut his beard
until I come."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" cried your Father in a great voice.
"<i>W-h-a-t?</i>"</p>

<p>But you pretended that you had not said anything,
because it was boy-talk and your Father
would not have understood it.</p>

<p>Never, never, never had you seen your Father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
so suffering; yet when he took you in his arms and
raised your face to his and quizzed you: "Little
Boy Jack, do you love me? Do you love me?"
you scanned him out of your Mother's made-over
eyes and answered him out of your Mother's made-over
mouth:</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o! N&mdash;o! I <i>don't</i> love you!"</p>

<p>And he jumped back as though you had knifed
him, and then laughed out loud as though he were
glad of the pain.</p>

<p>"But I ask you this," he persisted, and the shine
in his eyes was like a sunset glow in the deep woods,
and the touch of his hands would have lured you
into the very heart of the flame. "It is not probable,"
he said, "that your Dear Mother's child and
mine will go through Life without knowing Love.
When your Love-Time comes, if you understand
all Love's tragedies <i>then</i>, and forgive me, will you
send me a message?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," you cried out suddenly. "Oh, yes!
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!" and clung to him frantically
with your own boyish hands, and kissed him with
your Mother's mouth. But you did not love him.
It was your Mother's mouth that loved him.</p>

<p>So you went away to school in England and grew
up and up and up some more; but somehow this
latter growing up was a dull process without savor,
and the years went by as briefly and inconsequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
as a few dismissing sentences in a paragraph.
There were plenty of people to work with and play
with, but almost no one to think with, and your
hard-wrought book knowledge faded to nothingness
compared to the three paramount convictions
of your youthful experience, namely, that neither
coffee nor ocean nor Life tasted as good as it
smelled.</p>

<p>And then when you were almost twenty-one you
met "Clarice"!</p>

<p>It was a Christmas supper party in a caf&eacute;.
Some one looked up suddenly and called the name
"Clarice! Clarice!" and when your startled eyes
shot to the mark and saw her there in her easy,
dashing, gorgeous beauty, something in your brain
curdled, and all the lonesomeness, all the mystery,
all the elusiveness of Life pounded suddenly in
your heart like a captured Will-o'-the-Wisp.
"Clarice?" Here, then, was the end of your journey?
The eternal kindness? The flash of a white
wing across <i>your</i> stormy sea? "Clarice!" And
you looked across unbidden into her eyes and smiled
at her a gaspy, astonished smile that brought the
strangest light into her face.</p>

<p>Oh, but Clarice was very beautiful! Never had
you seen such a type. Her hair was black and solemn
as crape. Her eyes were bright and noisy as
jet. Her heart was barren as a blot of ink. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
she took your dreamy, paper-white boy life and
scourged it like a tongue of flame across a field of
Easter lilies!</p>

<p>And when the wonder of the flame was gone,
you sat aghast in your room among the charred,
scorched fragments of your Youth. The thirst for
death was very strong upon you, and the little, long,
narrow cup of your revolver gleamed very brimming
full of death's elixir. Even the June-time
could not save you. Your Mother's name was an
agony on your lips. The frenzied reiteration of
your thoughts scraped on your brain like a sledge
on gravel. You would drink very deep, you
thought, of your little slim cup of death. Yet the
thing that was tortured within you was scarcely
Love, and you had no message of understanding
for your Father. Just with wrecked life, wrecked
faith, wrecked courage, you huddled at your desk,
catching your breath for a second before you should
reach out your fretted fingers for the little cool
cunning, toy hand of Death.</p>

<p>"Once again," you said to yourself, "once again
I will listen to the children's voices in the garden.
Once again I will lure the smell of June roses into
my heart." The children prattled and passed.
Your hand reached out and fumbled. Once more
you shut your scalding eyes, hunched up your shoulders,
and breathed in like an ultimate tide the ravishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
sweetness of the June&mdash;one breath, another,
another&mdash;longer&mdash;longer. Oh, God in Heaven,
if one could only die of such an anesthetic&mdash;smothered
with sweetbrier, spiced with saffron,
buried in bride roses. <i>Die?</i> Your wild hand
leaped to the task and faltered stricken before the
strange, grim fact that blazed across your consciousness.
It was Thursday. It was your "Happy-Day!"
Your Father's words came pounding back
like blows into your sore brain! Your "Happy-Day!"
"No cruelty must ever defame it, no malice,
no gross bitterness!" Somewhere in air or
sky or sea there was a Mother-Woman who must
not be <i>hurt</i>. Your "Happy-Day?" HAPPY-DAY?
Rage and sorrow broke like a fearful
storm across your senses, and you put down your
head and cried like a child.</p>

<p>Tears? Again you felt on your lips that queer,
sad, salty pucker, that taste of the sea that gave
you a thirst not so much for water as for Life.
<i>Life?</i> <i>Life?</i> The thought thrilled through you
like new nerves. Your ashy pulses burst into
flame. Your dull heart jumped. Your vision
woke. Your memory quickened. You saw the
ocean, blue, blue, blue before you. You saw a
small, rude boy lie sprawling in the sand. You
saw a little girl's face, wild with wonder, tremulous
with sweetness. You felt again the flutter of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
kiss against your cheek. The little girl who&mdash;understood.
Your salt lips puckered into a smile,
and the smile ran back like a fuse into the inherent
happiness of your heart. Sam? Ladykin?
Home? You began to laugh! Haggard, harried,
wrecked, ruined, you began to laugh! Then, faltering
like a hysterical girl, you staggered down
the stairs, out of the house, along the streets to the
cable office, and sent a message to Sam.</p>

<p>"How long is your beard?" the message said.
"How long is your beard?" Just that silly,
magic message across miles and miles and miles of
waves and seaweeds. How the great cable must
have simpered with the foolishness of it. How the
pink coral must have chuckled. How the big, tin-foiled
fishes must have wondered.</p>

<p>You did not wait for an answer. What answer
was there? You could picture Sam standing in
stupefied awkwardness before the amazing nothingness
of such a message. But Ladykin would remember.
Oh, yes, Ladykin would remember. You
could see her peering past Sam's shoulder and
snatching out suddenly for the fluttering paper.
Ladykin would remember. What were six years?</p>

<p>Joy sang in your heart like a purr of a sea-shell.
The blue blur of ocean, the dear green smell of
mignonette, the rush of wind through the poplar
trees were tonic memories to you. You did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
wait to pack your things. You did not wait to
notify your Father. You sped like a wild boy to
the first wharf, to the first steamer that you could
find.</p>

<p>The week's ocean voyage went by like a year.
The silly waves dragged on the steamer like a tired
child on the skirts of its mother. Haste raged in
your veins like a fever. You wanted to throw all
the fat, heavy passengers overboard. You wanted
to swim ahead with a towing rope in your
teeth. You wanted to kill the Captain when he
stuttered. You wanted to flay the cook for serving
an extra course for dinner. Yet all the while the
huge machinery throbbed in rhythm, "Time <i>will</i>
pass. It <i>always does</i>. It <i>always does</i>. It <i>always
does</i>."</p>

<p>And then at last you stood again on your Native
Land, <i>alive, well, vital, at home!</i></p>

<p>With the sensation of an unbroken miracle, you
found your way again to the little Massachusetts
sea town, along the peaceful village walk to the big
brown house that turned so bleakly to the street.
There on the steps, wonder of wonders, you found
two elderly people, Bruno-Clarice and the Grandmother-Lady,
and your knees gave out very suddenly
and you sank down beside Bruno-Clarice and
smothered the bark right out of him.</p>

<p>"Good lack!" cried the Grandmother-Lady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
"Good <i>lack!</i>" and made so much noise that Sam
himself came running like mad from the next
house; and though he had no beard, you liked him
very much and shook and shook his hand until he
squealed.</p>

<p>With the Grandmother-Lady plying you with
questions, and Sam feeling your muscle, and Bruno-Clarice
trying to crawl into your lap like a pug-dog
baby, it was almost half an hour before you had a
chance to ask,</p>

<p>"Where is Ladykin?"</p>

<p>"She's down on the beach," said Sam. "I'll
go and help you find her."</p>

<p>You looked at Sam speculatively. "I'll give
you ten dollars if you won't," you said.</p>

<p>Sam considered the matter gravely before he
began to grin. "I wouldn't think of charging you
more than five," he acquiesced.</p>

<p>So you went off with Bruno-Clarice hobbling
close at your heels to find Ladykin for yourself.
When you saw her she was perched up on the very
top of the huddly gray rock playing tinkle tunes on
her mandolin, and you stole up so quietly behind
her that she did not see you till you were close beside
her.</p>

<p>Then she turned very suddenly and looked down
upon you and pretended that she did not know
you, with her color coming and going all luminous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and intermittent like a pink and white flashlight.
In six years you had not seen such a wonderful
playmatey face.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am 'Little Boy Jack' come back to marry
you," you began, but something in the wistful, shy
girl-tenderness of her face and eyes choked your
bantering words right off in your throat.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ladykin," you said, "I have come home,
and I am very tired, and I am very sad, and I am
very lonesome, and I have not been a very good
boy. But please be good to me! I am so lonesome
I cannot wait to make love to you. Oh,
<i>please</i>, <i>please</i> love me <i>n-o-w</i>. I <i>need</i> you to love
me N-O-W!"</p>

<p>Ladykin frowned. It was not a cross frown.
It was just a sort of a cosy corner for her thoughts.
Surprise cuddled there, and a sorry feeling, and a
great tenderness.</p>

<p>"You have not been a very good boy?" she repeated
after you.</p>

<p>The memory of a year crowded blackly upon
you. "No," you said, "I have not been a very
good boy, and I am very suffering-sad. But <i>please</i>
love me, and forgive me. No one has ever loved
me!"</p>

<p>The surprise and the sorry feeling in Ladykin's
forehead crowded together to make room for something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that was just <i>womanliness</i>. She began to
smile. It was the smile of a hurt person when the
opiate first begins to overtake the pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure it was an accidental badness,"
she volunteered softly. "If I were accidentally
bad, you would forgive <i>me</i>, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, yes," you stammered, and reached
up your lonesome hands to her.</p>

<p>"Then you don't have to make love," she whispered.
"It's all made," and slipped down into
your arms.</p>

<p>But something troubled her, and after a minute
she pushed you away and tried to renounce you.</p>

<p>"But it is not Thursday," she sobbed; "it is
Wednesday; and my name is not 'Clarice'; it is
Ladykin."</p>

<p>Then all the boyishness died out of you&mdash;the
sweet, idle reveries, the mystic responsibilities.
You shook your Father's dream from your eyes,
and squared your shoulders for your own realities.</p>

<p>"A Man must make his own Happy-Day,"
you cried, "and a Man must choose his own
Mate!"</p>

<p>Before your vehemence Ladykin winced back
against the rock and eyed you fearsomely.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will love you and cherish you," you
pleaded.</p>

<p>But Ladykin shook her head. "That is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
enough," she whispered. There was a kind of holy
scorn in her eyes.</p>

<p>Then a White Gull flashed like an apparition before
your sight. Ladykin's whole figure drooped,
her cheek paled, her little mouth quivered, her
vision narrowed. There with her eyes on the White
Gull and your eyes fixed on hers, you saw her shy
thoughts journey into the Future. You saw her
eyes smile, sadden, brim with tears, smile again,
and come homing back to you with a timid, glad
surprise as she realized that your thoughts too had
gone all the long journey with her.</p>

<p>She reached out one little hand to you. It was
very cold.</p>

<p>"If I should pass like the flash of a white wing,"
she questioned, "would you be true to me&mdash;and
<i>mine?</i>"</p>

<p>The Past, the Present, the Future rushed over
you in tumult. Your lips could hardly crowd so
big a vow into so small a word. "Oh, YES, YES,
YES!" you cried.</p>

<p>In reverent mastery you raised her face to yours.
"A Man must make his own Happy-Day," you repeated.
"A Man must make his own Happy-Day!"</p>

<p>Timorously, yet assentingly, she came back to
your arms. The whisper of her lips against your
ear was like the flutter of a rose petal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be Wednesday, then," she said, "for us
and&mdash;ours."</p>

<p>Clanging a strident bell across the magic stillness
of the garden, Sam bore down upon you like a
steam-engine out of tune.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say," he shouted, "for heaven's sake cut
it out and come to supper."</p>

<p>The startled impulse of your refusal faded before
the mute appeal in Ladykin's eyes.</p>

<p>"All right," you answered; "but first I must go
and cable 'love' to my Father."</p>

<p>"Oh, hurry!" cried Ladykin. Her word was
crumpled and shy as a kiss.</p>

<p>"Oh, hurry!" cried Sam. His thought was
straight and frank as a knife and fork.</p>

<p>Joy sang in your heart like a prayer that rhymed.
Your eager heart was pounding like a race horse.
The clouds in the sky were scudding to sunset.
The surf on the beach seemed all out of breath.
The green meadow path to the village stretched like
the paltriest trifle before a man's fleet running
pace.</p>

<p>"But I can't hurry," you said, for Bruno-Clarice
came poking his grizzled old nose into your hand.
"Oh, wait for me," he seemed to plead. "Oh,
please, <i>please</i> wait for me."</p>

<h2>THE RUNAWAY ROAD</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="162" height="164" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE Road ran spitefully up a steep,
hot, rocky, utterly shadeless hill,
and then at the top turned suddenly
in a flirty little green loop,
and looked back, and called "Follow
me!"</div>

<p>Wouldn't you have considered that a dare?</p>

<p>The Girl and the White Pony certainly took it
as such, and proceeded at once to "follow," though
the White Pony stumbled clatteringly on the rolling
stones, and the Girl had to cling for dear life to the
rocking pommels of her saddle.</p>

<p>It was a cruel climb, puff&mdash;pant&mdash;scramble&mdash;dust&mdash;glare&mdash;every
step of the way, but when
the two adventurers really reached the summit at
last, a great dark chestnut-tree loomed up for shade,
every sweet-smelling breeze in the world was there
to welcome them, and the whole green valley below
stretched out before them in the shining, woodsy
wonder of high noon and high June.</p>

<p>You know, yourself, just how the world looks
and feels and smells at high noon of a high June!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Even a pony stands majestically on the summit of
a high hill&mdash;neck arched, eyes rolling, mane blowing,
nostrils quivering. Even a girl feels a tug of
power at her heart.</p>

<p>And still the Road cried "Follow me!" though
it never turned its head again in doubt or coquetry.
It was a kind-looking Road now, all gracious and
sweet and tender, with rustly green overhead, and
soft green underfoot, and the pleasant, buzzing
drone of bees along its clovered edges.</p>

<p>"We might just as well follow it and see," argued
the Girl, and the White Pony took the suggestion
with a wild leap and cantered eagerly along
the desired way.</p>

<p>It was such an extraordinarily lonesome Road
that you could scarcely blame it for picking up
companionship as best it might. There was stretch
after stretch of pasture, and stretch after stretch
of woodland, and stretch after stretch of black-stumped
clearing&mdash;with never a house to cheer it,
or a human echo to break its ghostly stillness. Yet
with all its isolation and remoteness the landscape
had that certain vibrant, vivid air of self-consciousness
that thrills you with an uncanny sense of an
invisible presence&mdash;somewhere. It's just a trick
of June!</p>

<p>Tramps, pirates, even cannibals, seemed deliciously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
imminent. The Girl remembered reading
once of a lonely woman bicyclist who met a runaway
circus elephant at the turn of a country road.
Twelve miles from home is a long way off to have
anything happen.</p>

<p>Her heart began to quicken with the joyous sort
of fear that is one of the prime sweets of youth.
It's only when fear reaches your head that it hurts.
The loneliness, the mystery, the uncertainty, were
tonic to her. The color spotted in her cheeks. Her
eyes narrowed defensively to every startling detail
of woods or turf. Her ears rang with the sudden,
new acuteness of her hearing. She felt as though
she and the White Pony were stalking right across
the heartstrings of the earth. Once the White
Pony caught his foot and sent a scared sob into her
throat.</p>

<p>Oh, everything was magic! A little brown rabbit
reared up in the Road as big as a kangaroo, and
beckoned her with his ears. A red-winged blackbird
bulky as an eagle trumpeted a swamp-secret
to her as he passed. A tiny chipmunk in the wall
loomed like a lion in his lair, and sent a huge rock
crashing like an avalanche into the field. The
whole green and blue world seemed tingling with
toy noises, made suddenly big.</p>

<p>The White Pony's mouth was frothing with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
curb. The White Pony's coat was reeking wet with
noon and nervousness, but the Girl sat tense and
smiling and important in her saddle, as though just
once for all time she was the only italicized word in
the Book of Life.</p>

<p>"It's just the kind of a road that I like to travel
alone," she gasped, a little breathlessly, "but if I
were engaged and my man let me do it, I should
consider him&mdash;careless."</p>

<p>That was exactly the sort of Road it was!</p>

<p>Yet after three or four miles the White Pony
shook all the skittishness out of his feet, and settled
down to a zigzag, browsing-clover gait, and the
Girl relaxed at last, and sat loosely to ease her own
muscles, and slid the bridle trustingly across the
White Pony's neck.</p>

<p>Then she began to sing. Never in all her life
had she sung outside the restricting cage of house
or church. A green and blue loneliness on a June
day is really the only place in the world that is big
enough for singing! In dainty ballad, in impassioned
hymn, in opera, in anthem, the Girl's voice,
high and sweet and wild as a boy's, rang out in fluttering
tremolo. Over and over again, as though
half unconscious of the words, but enraptured with
the melody, she dwelt at last on that dream-song of
every ecstatic young soul who tarries for a moment
on the edge of an unfocused exultation:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
The King of Love my Shepherd is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose Goodness faileth never,</span><br />
I nothing lack if I am <i>his</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he is <i>mine f-o-r-e-v-e-r!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forever!&mdash;--Is <i>mine f-o-r-e-v-e-r!</i></span><br />
</div>

<p>Her pulsing, passionate crescendo came echoing
back to her from a gray granite hillside, and sent a
reverent thrill of power across her senses.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;into her rhapsody broke the
astonishing, harsh clash and clatter of a hay-rake.
The White Pony lurched, stood stock-still, gave a
hideous snort of terror, grabbed the bit in his teeth,
and bolted like mad on and on and on and on till
a quick curve in the Road dashed him into the
very lap of a tiny old gray farmhouse that completely
blocked the way.</p>

<p>In another second he would have stumbled across
the threshold and hurled his rider precipitously into
the front hall if she had not at that very second recovered
her "yank-hold" on his churning mouth
and wrenched him back so hard that any animal but
a horse would have sat down.</p>

<p>Then the girl straightened up very tremblingly
in her saddle and said "O&mdash;h!"</p>

<p>Some one had to say something, for there in the
dooryard close beside her were an Artist, a Bossy,
and a White Bulldog, who all instantaneously,
without the slightest cordiality or greeting, stopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
whatever they were doing and began to stare at
her.</p>

<p>Now it's all very well to go dashing like mad
into a person's front yard on a runaway horse.
Anybody could see that you didn't do it on purpose;
but when at last you have stopped dashing,
what are you going to do next, particularly when
the Road doesn't go any farther? Shall you say,
"Isn't this a pleasant summer?" or "What did
you really like best at the theater last winter?" If
you gallop out it looks as though you were frightened.
If you amble out, you might hear some one
laugh behind your back, which is infinitely worse
than being grabbed on the stairs.</p>

<p>The situation was excessively awkward. And
the Artist evidently was not clever in conversational
emergencies.</p>

<p>The Girl straightened her gray slouch hat.
Then she ran the cool metal butt of her riding-whip
back and forth under the White Pony's sweltering
mane. Then she swallowed very hard once
or twice and remarked inanely:</p>

<p>"Did the Road go right into the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Artist, with a nervous blue dab at
his canvas.</p>

<p>The Girl's ire rose at his churlishness. "If that
is so," she announced, "if the Road really went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
right into the house, I'll just wait here a minute
till it comes out again."</p>

<p>But the Artist never smiled an atom to make
things easier, though the Bossy began to tug most
joyously at his chain, and the White Bulldog rolled
over and over with delight.</p>

<p>The Girl would have given anything now to escape
at full speed down the Road along which she
had come, but escape of that sort had suddenly assumed
the qualities of a panicky, ignominious retreat,
so she parried for time by riding right up
behind the Artist and watching him change a perfectly
blue canvas sky into a regular tornado.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think it's going to rain as hard
as that?" she teased. "Perhaps I'd better settle
down here until the storm is over."</p>

<p>But the Artist never smiled or spoke. He just
painted and sniffed as though he worked by steam,
and when his ears had finally grown so crimson that
apoplexy seemed impending, she took pity on his
miserable embarrassment and backed even the
shadow of her pony out of his sight. Then with a
desperate effort at perfect ease she remarked:</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I guess I'll ride round to your back
door. Perhaps the Road came out that way and
went on without me."</p>

<p>But though she and the White Pony hunted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
every direction through white birch and swaying
alders, they found no possible path by which the
Road could have escaped, and were obliged at last
to return with some hauteur, and make as dignified
an exit as possible from the scene.</p>

<p>The Artist bowed with stiff relief at their departure,
but the White Bulldog preceded them with
friendly romps and yells, and the Bossy pulled up
his iron hitching stake and chain and came clanking
after them with furious bounds and jingles.</p>

<p>No one but the White Pony would have stood
the racket for a moment, and even the White Pony
began to feel a bit staccato in his feet. The Girl
kept her saddle like a circus rider, but the amusement
on her face was just a trifle studied. It was
a fine procession, clamor and all, with the Bulldog
scouting ahead, the White Pony following skittishly,
and the Bossy see-sawing behind, clanking a
dungeon chain that left a cloud of dust as far as you
could see.</p>

<p>It must have startled the Youngish Man who
loomed up suddenly at a bend of the Road and
caught the wriggling Bulldog in his arms.</p>

<p>"Who comes here?" he cried with a regular
war-whoop of a challenge. "Who comes here?"</p>

<p>"Just a lady and a bossy," said the Girl, as she
reined in the Pony abruptly, and sent the Bossy
caroming off into the bushes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's my brother's Bossy," protested the
Youngish Man.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it isn't," the Girl explained a little
wearily. "It's mine now. It chose between us."</p>

<p>The Youngish Man eyed her with some amusement.</p>

<p>"Did you really see my brother at the house?"
he probed.</p>

<p>The Girl nodded, flushing. It was very hot, and
she was beginning to feel just a wee bit faint and
hungry and irritable.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw your brother," she reiterated, "but
I didn't seem to care for him. I rode by mistake
right into the picture he was painting. There's
probably paint all over me. It was very awkward,
and he didn't do a thing to make it easier. I
abominate that kind of person. If a man can't do
anything else he can always ask you if you wouldn't
like a drink of water!" She scowled indignantly.
"It was the Road's fault anyway! I was just exploring,
and the Road cried 'Follow me,' and I followed&mdash;a
little faster than I meant to&mdash;and the
Road ran right into your house and shut the door.
Oh, <i>slammed</i> the door right in my face!"</p>

<p>"Would you like a drink of water, <i>now?</i>" suggested
the Youngish Man.</p>

<p>"No, I thank you," said the Girl, with stubborn
dignity, and then weakened to the alluring offer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with "But my White Pony is very cruelly
thirsty."</p>

<p>Both adventurers looked pretty jaded with heat
and dust.</p>

<p>The Youngish Man led the way into a tiny, pungent
wood-path that ended in a gurgling spring-hole,
where the White Pony nuzzled his nose with deep-breathed,
dripping satisfaction, while the Girl kept
to her saddle and looked down on the Youngish
Man with frank interest.</p>

<p>He looked very picturesque and brown and clever
in his khaki suit with a game bag slung across his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're not a hunter," she exclaimed impulsively.
"You're not a hunter&mdash;because you
haven't any gun."</p>

<p>"No," said the Man, "I'm a collector."</p>

<p>The Girl cried out with pleasure and clapped her
hands. "A collector?&mdash;oh, goody! So am I!
What do you collect? Minerals? Oh&mdash;dear!
<i>Mine</i> is lots more interesting. I collect adventures."</p>

<p>"Adventures?" The Man made no slightest effort
to conceal his amused curiosity. "Adventures?
Now I call that a jolly thing to collect. Is
it a good country to work in? And what have you
found?"</p>

<p>The Girl smiled at him appreciatively&mdash;a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
flitting, whimsical sort of smile, and commenced to
rummage in the blouse of her white shirt-waist,
from which she finally produced a small, red-covered
notebook. She fluttered its diminutive pages
for a second, and then began to laugh:</p>

<p>"You'd better sit down if you really want to
hear what I've found."</p>

<p>The Man dropped comfortably into place beside
the spring and watched her. She was very watchable.
Some people have to be beautiful to rivet
your attention. Some people <i>don't</i> have to be.
It's all a matter of temperament. Her hair was
very, very brown, though, and her eyes were deep
and wide and hazel, and the red in her cheeks came
and went with every throb of her heart.</p>

<p>"Of course," she explained apologetically, "of
course I haven't found a lot of things yet&mdash;I've
only been working at it a little while. But I've
collected a 'Runaway Accident with the Rural
Free-Delivery Man.' It was awfully scary and interesting.
And I've collected a 'Den of Little
Foxes Down in the Woods Back of My House,' and
'Two Sunrises with a Crazy Woman who Thinks
that the Sun Can't Get Up Until She Does,' and
I've collected a 'Country Camp-Meeting all Hallelujahs
and By Goshes,' and a 'Circus Where I
Spent All Day with the Snake-Charmer,' and a
'Midnight Ride Alone through the Rosedale Woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in a Thunder-Storm.' Of course, as I say, I
haven't found a lot of things yet, but then it's only
the middle of June and I have two more weeks' vacation
yet."</p>

<p>The Man put back his head and laughed, but it
was a pleasant sort of laugh that flooded all the
stern lines in his face.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I never thought of making a regular
business of collecting adventures," he admitted,
"but it certainly is a splendid idea. But aren't
you ever afraid?" he asked. "Aren't you ever
afraid, for instance, riding round on a lonesome trip
like this?"</p>

<p>The Girl laughed. "Yes," she acknowledged,
"I'm often afraid of&mdash;squirrels&mdash;and falling
twigs&mdash;and black-looking stumps. I'm often
afraid of toy noises and toy fears&mdash;but I never
saw a real fear in all my life. Even when you
jumped up in the Road I wasn't afraid of you&mdash;because
you are a gentleman&mdash;and&mdash;gentlemen
are my friends."</p>

<p>"Have you many friends?" asked the Man. The
question seemed amusingly justifiable. "You look
to me about eighteen. Girls of your age are usually
too busy collecting Love to collect anything else&mdash;even
ideas. Have you collected any Love?"</p>

<p>The Girl threw out her hands in joking protest.
"Collected any Love? Why, I don't even know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
what Love looks like! Maybe what I'd collect
would be&mdash;poison ivy." Her eyes narrowed a little.
Her voice quivered the merest trifle.
"There's a Boy at Home&mdash;who talks&mdash;a little&mdash;about
it. But how can I tell that it's Love?"</p>

<p>Her sudden vehemency startled him. "Where
<i>is</i> 'Home'?" he asked.</p>

<p>For immediate answer the Girl slipped down from
the White Pony's back, and loosened the saddle
creakingly before she helped herself to a long, dripping
draught from the birch cup that hung just over
the spring.</p>

<p>"You're nice to talk to," she acknowledged,
"and almost no one is nice to talk to. It's a whole
year since I've talked right out to any one! Where
do I live? Well, my headquarters are in New
York, but my heartquarters are over at Rosedale.
There's quite a difference, you know!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Man, "I remember&mdash;there used
to&mdash;be&mdash;quite a difference. But how did you
ever happen to think of collecting adventures?"</p>

<p>The girl pulled at the White Pony's mane for
a long, hesitating moment, then she turned and
looked searchingly into the Man's face. She very
evidently liked what she saw.</p>

<p>"I collect adventures because I am lonesome!"
Her voice shook a little, but her eyes were frankly
untroubled. "I collect adventures because the life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that interests me doesn't happen to come to me, and
I have to go out and search for it!&mdash;I'm companion
all the year to a woman who doesn't know
right from wrong in any dear, big sense, but who
could define propriety and impropriety to you till
your ears split. And all her friends are just like
her. They haven't any mental muscle to them.
It's just dress and etiquette, dress and etiquette,
dress and etiquette! So I have to live all alone
in my head, and think and think and think,
till my poor brain churns and overlaps like a surf
without any shore. Do you know what I mean?
Then when my June vacation comes, I run right off
to Rosedale and collect all the adventures I possibly
can to take back with me for the long dreary
year. Things to think about, you know, when I
have to sit up at night giving medicine, or when I
have to mend heavy black silk clothes, or when the
dinners are so long that I could scream over the
extra delay of a salad course. So I make June a
sort of pranky, fancy-dress party for my soul. Do
you know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you mean," said the Man.
"I know just what you mean. You mean you're
eighteen. That's the whole of it. You mean that
there's no fence to your pasture, no bottom to your
cup, no crust to your bread. You mean that you
can't sleep at night for the pounding of your heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
You mean most of all that there's no limit to your
vision. You're inordinately keen after life.
That's all. You'll get over it!"</p>

<p>"<i>I won't get over it!</i>" There was fire in the
Girl's eyes and she drew her breath sharply. "I
say I <i>won't</i> get over it! There's nothing on earth
that could stale me! If I live to be a hundred I
sha'n't wither!&mdash;why, how could I?"</p>

<p>Buoyant, blooming, aquiver with startled emotions,
she threw out her hands with a passionate
gesture of protest.</p>

<p>The Man shook his shoulders and jumped up.
"Perhaps you're right," he muttered. "Perhaps
you <i>are</i> the kind that won't ever grow old. If you
are&mdash;Heaven help you! Youth's nothing but a
wound, anyway. Do you want to be a wound that
never heals?" He laughed stridently.</p>

<p>Then the Girl began to fumble through sudden
tears at the buckles of her saddle. Her growing
hunger and faintness and the heat of the day were
telling on her.</p>

<p>"You must think me a crazy fool," she confessed,
"the way I have plunged into personalities. Why,
I could go a whole year with an alien running-mate
and never breathe a word or a sigh about myself,
but with some people&mdash;the second you see them
you know they are part of your chord. Chord is
the only term in music that I understand, and I understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that as though I had made the word myself."
She tried to laugh. "Now I'm going
home! I've had a good time. You seem almost
like a friend. I've never had a talky friend."</p>

<p>And she was in her saddle and half-way down
the wood-path before his mind quickened to cry out
"Stop! Wait a minute!"</p>

<p>A little out of breath he caught up with her, and
stood for a moment like an embarrassed schoolboy,
though his face in the sunlight was as old as young
forty.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you haven't had much of an adventure
this morning," he volunteered whimsically.
"If you really want an adventure why don't you
come back to the house and have dinner with my
brother and me? There's no one else there.
Think how it would tease my brother! You're
twelve or fifteen miles from home, and it's already
two o'clock and very hot. My brother has done
some pictures that are going to be talked about next
winter, and I&mdash;I've got rather a conspicuous position
ahead of me in Washington. Wouldn't it
amuse you a little bit afterward, if any one spoke
of us, to remember our little farmhouse dinner to-day?&mdash;Would
you be afraid to come?" His last
question was very direct.</p>

<p>A look came into the Girl's eyes that was very
good for a man to see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, of course I wouldn't be afraid to come,"
she said. "Gentlemen are my friends."</p>

<p>But she was shy about going, just the same, with
a certain frank, boyish shyness that only served to
emphasize the general artlessness of her verve.</p>

<p>With a quick dive into the bushes the Man collared
the Bossy and transferred his clanking chain
to the bit of the astonished White Pony.</p>

<p>"Now you've got to come," he laughed up at
her, and the whole party started back for the tiny
old gray farmhouse where the Artist greeted them
with sad concern.</p>

<p>"I've brought Miss Girl back to have dinner
with us," announced the Pony-leader cheerfully,
relying on his brother's serious nature to overlook
any strangeness of nomenclature. "You evidently
didn't remember meeting her at Mrs. Moyne's
house-party last spring?"</p>

<p>The Girl fell readily into the game. She turned
the White Pony loose in the dooryard, and then
went into the queer old kitchen, rolled up her
sleeves, wound herself round with a blue-checked
apron, and commenced to work. She had a deft
touch at household matters, and the Man followed
her about as humbly as though he himself had not
been adequately providing meals for the past two
months.</p>

<p>The color rose high in the Girl's cheeks, and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
voice took on the thrill and breathiness of amused
excitement. Wherever she found a huddle of best
china or linen or silver she raided it for her use,
and the table flared forth at last with a dainty,
inconsequent prettiness that quite defied the Artist's
prescribed rules for beauty.</p>

<p>It was a funny dinner, with an endless amount
of significant bantering going on right under the
Artist's sunburned nose. Yet for all the mirth of
the situation, the Girl had quite a chance to study
the face of her special host, in all its full detail of
worldliness, of spirituality, of hardness, of sweetness.
Her final impression, as her first one, was
of a wonderful affinity and congeniality. "His
face is like a harbor for all my stormy thoughts,"
was the way she described it to herself.</p>

<p>After dinner the three washed up the dishes as
sedately as though they had been working together
day-in, day-out through the whole season, and after
that the Artist escaped as quickly as possible to
catch a cloud effect which he seemed to consider
preposterously vital.</p>

<p>Then with a dreary little feeling of a prize-pleasure
all spent and gone, the Girl went over to the
mirror in the sitting-room and pinned on her gray
slouch hat and patted her hair and straightened her
belt.</p>

<p>But it was not her own reflection that interested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
her most. The mirror made a fine frame for the
whole quaint room, with its dingy landscape wall-paper
from which the scarlet petticoat of a shepherdess
or the vivid green of a garland stood out
with cheerful crudity. The battered, blackened
fireplace was lurid here and there with gleams of
copper kettles, and a huge gray cat purred comfortably
in the curving seat of a sun-baked rocking-chair.</p>

<p>It was a good picture to take home in your mind
for remembrance, when walls should be brick and
rooms ornate and life hackneyed, and the Girl shut
her eyes for a second, experimentally, to fix the
vision in her consciousness.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes again the Man was
struggling through the doorway dragging a small,
heavy trunk.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't go yet!" he exclaimed. "Here are
a lot of your things in this trunk. I brought them
in to show you."</p>

<p>And he dragged the trunk to the middle of the
room and knelt down on the floor and commenced to
unlock it.</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> things?" cried the Girl in amazement, and
ran across the room and sat down on the floor beside
him. "<i>My</i> things?"</p>

<p>There was a funny little twist to the Man's
mouth that never relaxed all the time he was tinkering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
with the lock. "Yes&mdash;<i>your</i> things," was
all he said till the catch yielded finally, and he raised
the cover to display the full contents to his companion's
curious eyes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/gs04.jpg" width="332" height="500" alt="Instinctively she clasped it to her" title="" />
<span class="caption">Instinctively she clasped it to her</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh&mdash;<i>books!</i>" she cried out, with a sudden,
sweeping flush of comprehension, and darted her
hand into the dusty pile and pulled out a well-worn
copy of the Rubaiyat. Instinctively she clasped it
to her.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" said the Youngish Man quizzically.
"I thought that was one of your books.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"When Time lets slip a little, perfect hour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, take it&mdash;for it will not come again."</span><br />
</div>

<p>His eyes narrowed, and his hands reached nervously
to regain possession of the volume. Then he
laughed.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>, also, used to think that Life was made for
me," he scoffed teasingly. "It's a glorious idea&mdash;as
long as it lasts! You take every harsh old
happening and every flimsy friendship and line it
with your own silk, and then sit by and say, 'Oh,
<i>isn't</i> the World a rustly, shimmery, luxurious place!'
And all the time the happening <i>is</i> harsh, and the
friendship <i>is</i> flimsy, and it's just your own perishable
silk lining that does the rustle and the shimmer
and the luxury act. Oh, I suppose that's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
'woman talk' about silk linings, but I know a
thing or two, even if I am a man."</p>

<p>But the radiancy of the Girl's face defied his
cynicism utterly. Her eyes were absolutely fathomless
with Youth.</p>

<p>Then his mood changed suddenly. He reached
out with a little brooding gesture of protection.
"These are my college books," he confided, "my
Dream Library. I've scarcely thought of them for
a dozen years. I don't meet many dreamers nowadays.
You've probably got a lot of newer books
than these, but I'll wager you anything in the
world that every book here is a precious friend to
you. I shouldn't wonder if your own copies
opened exactly to the same places. Here's young
Keats with his shadowing tragedy. How you have
mooned over it. And here's Tennyson. What
about the starlit vision:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"And on her lover's arm she leant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And round her waist she felt it fold,&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The Girl took up the words softly in unison:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"And far across the hills they went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To that new world which is the old."</span><br />
</div>

<p>In rushing, eager tenderness she browsed through
one book after another, sometimes silently, sometimes
with a little crooning quotation, where corners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
were turned down. And when she had quite
finished, her eyes were like stars, and she looked
up tremulously, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Why, we&mdash;like&mdash;just&mdash;the&mdash;same&mdash;things."</p>

<p>But the Youngish Man did not smile back at her.
His face in that second turned suddenly old-looking
and haggard and gray. He threw the books back
into their places, and slammed the trunk-cover with
a bang.</p>

<p>For just the infinitesimal fraction of a second
the Man and the Girl looked into each other's eyes.
For just that infinitesimal fraction of a second the
Man's eyes were as unfathomable as the Girl's.</p>

<p>Then with a great sniff and scratching and whine,
the White Bulldog pushed his way into the room,
and the Girl jumped up in alarm to note that the sun
was dropping very low in the west, and that the
shadows of late afternoon crept palpably over her
companion's face.</p>

<p>For a moment the two stood awkwardly without
a word, and then the Girl with a conscious effort
at lightness queried:</p>

<p>"But <i>where</i> did the Runaway Road go to? I
<i>must</i> find out."</p>

<p>The Youngish Man turned as though something
had startled him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather leave things just as they
are?" he asked.</p>

<p>"NO!" The Girl stamped her foot vehemently.
"NO! I want everything. I want the whole adventure."</p>

<p>"The whole adventure?" The Youngish Man
winced at the phrase, and then laughed to cover his
seriousness.</p>

<p>"All right," he acquiesced. "I'll show you just
where the Runaway Road goes to."</p>

<p>Without further explanation he stepped to the
dooryard and scooped up two heaping handfuls of
gravel from the Road. As he came back into the
room he trailed a little line of earth across the
floor to the foot of the stairs, and threw the remaining
handful up the steps just as a heedless
child might have done.</p>

<p>"Go follow your Runaway Road," he smiled,
"and see where it leads to, if you are so eager!
I'm going down to the woods to see if my brother
is quite lost in his clouds."</p>

<p>Wasn't that <i>another</i> dare? It seemed a craven
thing to tease for a climax and then shirk it. She
had never shirked anything yet that was right, no
matter how unusual it was.</p>

<p>She started for the stairs. One step, two steps,
three steps, four steps&mdash;her riding-boots grated on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the gravel. "Oh, you funny Runaway Road," she
trembled, "where <i>do</i> you go to?"</p>

<p>At the top stairs a tiny waft of earth turned her
definitely into the first doorway.</p>

<p>She took one step across the threshold, and then
stood stock-still and stared. It was a <i>woman's
room</i>. And from floor to ceiling and from wall
to wall flaunted an incongruous, moneyed effort to
blot out all temperament and pang and trenchant
life-history from one spot at least of the little old
gray farmhouse. Bauble was there, and fashion
and novelty, but the whole gay decoration looked
and felt like the sumptuous dressing of a child
whom one <i>hated</i>.</p>

<p>With a gasp of surprise the Girl went over and
looked at herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I look queer in a room like this?"
she whispered to herself. But she didn't look
queer at all. She only felt queer, like a flatted
note.</p>

<p>Then she hurried right down the stairs again,
and went out in the yard, and caught the White
Pony, and climbed up into her saddle.</p>

<p>The Youngish Man came running to say good-by.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>The Girl's eyes were steady as her hand. If her
heart fluttered there was no sign of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it was a <i>woman's</i> room," she answered
to his inflection.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Youngish Man quite simply.
"It is my wife's room. My wife is in Europe getting
her winter clothes. All people do not happen&mdash;to&mdash;like&mdash;the&mdash;same&mdash;things."</p>

<p>The Girl put out her hand to him with bright-faced
friendliness.</p>

<p>"In Europe?" she repeated. "Indeed, I shall
not be so local when I think of her. Wherever
she is&mdash;all the time&mdash;I shall always think of your
wife as being&mdash;most of anything else&mdash;<i>in luck</i>."</p>

<p>She drew back her hand and chirruped to the
White Pony, but the Youngish Man detained her.</p>

<p>"Wait a second," he begged. "Here's a copy
of Matthew Arnold for you to take home as a
token, though there's only one thing in it for us,
and you won't care for that until you are forty.
You can play it's about the mountains that you
pass going home. Here it is:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Unaffrighted by the silence round them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Undistracted by the sights they see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>THESE</i> demand not that the things about them</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Yield them love, amusement, sympathy."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Rather cracked-ice comfort, isn't it?" the
Girl laughed as she tucked the little book into her
blouse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather," said the Youngish Man, "but cracked
ice is good for fevers, and Youth is the most raging
fever that I know about."</p>

<p>Then he stood back from the White Pony, and
smiled quizzically, and the Girl turned the White
Pony's head, and started down the Road.</p>

<p>Just before the first curve in the alders, she
whirled in her saddle and looked back. The
Youngish Man was still standing there watching
her, and she held up her hand as a final signal.
Then the Road curved her out of sight.</p>

<p>It was chilly now in the gloaming shade of the
woods, and home seemed a long way off. After
a mile or two the White Pony dragged as though
his feet were sore, and when she tried to force him
into a jarring canter the sharp corners of the
Matthew Arnold book goaded cruelly against her
breast.</p>

<p>"It isn't going to be a very pleasant ride," she
said. "But it was quite an adventure. I don't
know whether to call it the 'Adventure of the Runaway
Road' or the 'Adventure of the Little Perfect
Hour.'"</p>

<p>Then she shivered a little and tried to keep the
White Pony in the rapidly fading sun spots of the
Road, but the shadows grew thicker and cracklier
and more lonesome every minute, and the only familiar
sound of life to be heard was 'way off in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the distance, where some little lost bossy was calling
plaintively for its mother.</p>

<p>There were plenty of unfamiliar sounds, though.
Things&mdash;nothing special, but just Things&mdash;sighed
mournfully from behind a looming boulder.
Something dark, with gleaming eyes, scudded
madly through the woods. A ghastly, mawkish
chill like tomb-air blew dankly from the swamp.
Myriads of tiny insects droned venomously. The
White Pony shied at a flash of heat lightning, and
stumbled bunglingly on a rolling stone. Worst of
all, far behind her, sounded the unmistakable tagging
step of some stealthy creature.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life the girl was
frightened&mdash;hideously, sickeningly frightened of
Night!</p>

<p>Back in the open clearing round the tiny farmhouse,
the light, of course, still lingered in a lulling
yellow-gray. It would be an hour yet, she reasoned,
before the great, black loneliness settled
there. She could picture the little, simple, homely,
companionable activities of early evening&mdash;the
sputter of a candle, the good smell of a pipe, the
steamy murmur of a boiling kettle. O&mdash;h! But
could one go back wildly and say: "It is darker
and cracklier than I supposed in the woods, and
I am a wilful Girl, and there are fifteen wilful
miles between me and home&mdash;and there is a cemetery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
on the way, and a new grave&mdash;and a squalid
camp of gypsies&mdash;and a broken bridge&mdash;<i>and I
am afraid! What shall I do?</i>"</p>

<p>She laughed aloud at the absurdity, and cut at
the White Pony sharply with her whip. It would
be lighter, she thought, on the open village road
below the hill.</p>

<p>Love? Amusement? Sympathy? She shook
her young fist defiantly at the hulking contour of
a stolid, bored old mountain that loomed up through
a gap in the trees. "<i>Drat</i> Self-sufficiency," she
cursed, with a vehement little-girl curse. "I
won't be a bored old Mountain. I <i>won't!</i> I
<i>won't!</i> I <i>won't!</i>"</p>

<p>All her short, eager life, it seemed, she had been
floundering like a stranger in a strange land&mdash;no
father or mother, no chum, no friend, no lover, no
anything&mdash;and now just for a flash, just for one
"little, perfect hour" she had found a voice at
last that <i>spoke her own language</i>, and the voice
belonged to a Man who belonged to another woman!</p>

<p>She remembered her morning's singing with a
bitter pang. "<i>Nothing</i> is mine forever. Nothing,
<i>nothing</i>, NOTHING!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>A great, black, smothering isolation like a pall
settled down over her, and seemed to pin itself with
a stab through her heart. Everybody, once in his
time, has tried to imagine his Dearest-one absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
nonexistent, unborn, and tortured himself
with the possibility of such a ghostly vacuum in
his life. To the Girl suddenly it seemed as though
puzzled, lonely, unmated, all her short years, she
had stumbled now precipitously on the Great Cause
Of It&mdash;a <i>vacuum</i>. It was not that she had lost
any one, or missed any one. <i>It was simply that
some one had never been born!</i></p>

<p>The thought filled her with a whimsical new
terror. She pounded the White Pony into a gallop
and covered the last half-mile of the Runaway
Road. At the crest of the hill the valley vista
brightened palely and the White Pony gave a
whimper of awakened home instinct. Cautiously,
warily, with legs folding like a jack-knife he began
the hazardous descent.</p>

<p>Was he sleepy? Was he clumsy? Was he footsore?
Just before the Runaway Road smoothed
out into the village highway his knees wilted suddenly
under him, and he pitched headlong with a
hideous lurch that sent the Girl hurtling over his
neck into a pitiful, cluttered heap among the dust
and stones, where he came back after his first panicky
run, and blew over her with dilated nostrils,
and whimpered a little before he strayed off to a
clover patch on the highway below.</p>

<p>Twilight deepened to darkness. Darkness quickened
at last to stars. It was Night, real Night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
black alike in meadow, wood, and dooryard, before
the Girl opened her eyes again. Part of an orange
moon, waning, wasted, decadent, glowed dully in
the sky.</p>

<p>For a long time, stark-still and numb, she lay
staring up into space, conscious of nothing except
consciousness. It was a floaty sort of feeling.
Was she dead? That was the first thought that
twittered in her brain. Gradually, though, the reassuring
edges of her cheeks loomed into sight,
and a beautiful, real pain racked along her spine and
through her side. It was the pain that whetted
her curiosity. "If it's my neck that's broken,"
she reasoned, "it's all over. If it's my heart it's
only just begun."</p>

<p>Then she wriggled one hand very cautiously,
and a White Doggish Something came over and
licked her fingers. It felt very kind and refreshing.</p>

<p>Now and then on the road below, a carriage
rattled by, or one voice called to another. She
didn't exactly care that no one noticed her, or
rescued her&mdash;indeed, she was perfectly, sluggishly
comfortable&mdash;but she remembered with alarming
distinctness that once, on a scorching city pavement,
she had gone right by a bruised purple pansy that
lay wilting underfoot. She could remember just
how it looked. It had a funny little face, purple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and yellow, and all twisted with pain. And she
had gone right by. And she felt very sorry about
it now.</p>

<p>She was still thinking about that purple pansy
an hour later, when she heard the screeching toot
of an automobile, the snort of a horse, and the terrified
clatter of hoofs up the hill. Then the White
Doggish Something leaped up and barked a sharp,
fluttery bark like a signal.</p>

<p>The next thing she knew, pleasant voices and a
lantern were coming toward her. "They will be
frightened," she thought, "to find a body in the
Road." So, "Coo-o! Coo-o!" she cried in a
faint little voice.</p>

<p>Then quickly a bright light poured into her face,
and she swallowed very hard with her eyes for a
whole minute before she could see that two men
were bending over her. One of the men was just
a man, but the other one was the Boy From Home.
As soon as she saw him she began to cry very softly
to herself, and the Boy From Home took her right
up in his great, strong arms and carried her down
to the cushioned comfort of the automobile.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;did&mdash;you&mdash;come&mdash;from?" she
whispered smotheringly into his shoulder.</p>

<p>The harried, boyish face broke brightly into a
smile.</p>

<p>"I came from Rosedale to-night, to find <i>you!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
he said. "But they sent me up here on business
to survey a new Road."</p>

<p>"To survey a new Road?" she gasped. "That's&mdash;good.
All the Roads that I know&mdash;go&mdash;to&mdash;Other
People's Homes."</p>

<p>Her head began to droop limply to one side.
She felt her senses reeling away from her again.
"If&mdash;I&mdash;loved&mdash;you," she hurried to ask,
"would&mdash;you&mdash;make&mdash;me&mdash;a&mdash;safe Road&mdash;<i>all
my own?</i>"</p>

<p>The Boy From Home gave a scathing glance
at the hill that reared like a crag out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"If I couldn't make a safer Road than <i>that</i>&mdash;"
he began, then stopped abruptly, with a sudden
flash of illumination, and brushed his trembling lips
across her hair.</p>

<p>"I'll make you the safest, smoothest Road that
ever happened," he said, "if I have to dig it with
my fingers and gnaw it with my teeth."</p>

<p>A little, snuggling sigh of contentment slipped
from the Girl's lips.</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;you&mdash;suppose," she whispered, "do&mdash;you&mdash;suppose&mdash;that&mdash;after&mdash;all&mdash;<i>this</i>&mdash;was&mdash;the
real&mdash;end&mdash;of&mdash;the Runaway Road?"</p>

<h2>SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN OCTOBER</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 166px;">
<img src="images/drop_m.png" width="166" height="164" alt="M" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />ONDAY, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, it had rained.
Day in, day out, day in, day out,
day in, it had rained and rained
and rained and rained and rained,
till by Friday night the great blue
mountains loomed like a chunk of ruined velvet,
and the fog along the valley lay thick and gross as
mildewed porridge.</div>

<p>It was a horrid storm. Slop and shiver and rotting
leaves were rampant. Even in Alrik's snug little
house the chairs were wetter than moss. Clothes
in the closets hung lank and clammy as undried
bathing-suits. Worst of all, across every mirror
lay a breathy, sad gray mist, as though ghosts had
been back to whimper there over their lost faces.</p>

<p>It had never been so before in the first week of
October.</p>

<p>There were seven of us who used to tryst there
together every year in the gorgeous Scotch-plaid
Autumn, when the reds and greens and blues and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
browns and yellows lapped and overlapped like a
festive little kilt for the Young Winter, and every
crisp, sweet day that dawned was like the taste of
cider and the smell of grapes.</p>

<p>That is the kind of October well worth living,
and seven people make a wonderfully proper number
to play together in the country, particularly if
six of you are men and women, and one of you is
a dog.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, it was October, and October alone,
that lured us. We certainly differed astonishingly
in most of our other tastes.</p>

<p>Three of us belonged to the peaceful Maine
woods&mdash;Alrik and Alrik's Wife and his Growly-Dog-Gruff.
Four of us came from the rackety
cities&mdash;the Partridge Hunter, the Blue Serge Man,
the Pretty Lady, and Myself&mdash;a newspaper
woman.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I may add that the Blue Serge Man
and the Pretty Lady were husband and wife, but
did not care much about it, having been married,
very evidently, in some gorgeously ornate silver-plated
emotion that they had mistaken at the time
for the "sterling" article. The shine and beauty
of the marriage had long since worn away, leaving
things quite a little bit edgy here and there. Alrik's
young spouse was, wonder of wonders, a transplanted
New York chorus girl. No other biographical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
data are necessary except that Growly-Dog-Gruff
was a brawling, black, fat-faced mongrel
whose complete sense of humor had been
slammed in the door at a very early age. For
some inexplainable reason, he seemed to hold all
the rest of the crowd responsible for the catastrophe,
but was wildly devoted to me. He showed this
devotion by never biting me as hard as he bit the
others.</p>

<p>Yet even with Growly-Dog-Gruff included among
our assets, we had always considered ourselves an
extremely superior crowd.</p>

<p>There were seven of us, I said, who <i>used</i> to
tryst there together every autumn. But now, since
the year before, three of us had <i>gone</i>, Alrik's
Wife, Alrik's Dog, and the Blue Serge Man. So
the four of us who remained huddled very close
around the fire on that stormy, dreary, ghastly first
night of our reunion, and talked-talked-talked and
laughed-laughed-laughed just as fast as we possibly
could for fear that a moment's silence would plunge
us all down, whether or no, into the sorrow-chasm
that lurked so consciously on every side. Yet we
certainly looked and acted like a very jovial quartet.</p>

<p>The Pretty Lady, to be sure, was a black wisp
of crape in her prim, four-footed chair; but Alrik's
huge bulk tipped jauntily back against the wainscoting
in a gaudy-colored Mackinaw suit, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
merely a broad band of black across his left sleeve&mdash;as
one who, neither affirming nor denying the
formalities of grief, would laconically warn the
public at large to "Keep Off My Sorrow." I
liked Alrik, and I had liked Alrik's Wife. But I
had loved Alrik's Dog. I do not care especially for
temper in women, but a surly dog, or a surly man,
is as irresistibly funny to me as Chinese music, there
is so little plot to any of them.</p>

<span class="caption">The four of us who remained huddled very close around the fire</span>
</div>

<p>But now on the hearth-rug at my feet the Partridge
Hunter lay in amiable corduroy comfort,
with the little puff of his pipe and his lips throbbing
out in pleasant, dozy regularity. He had
traveled in Japan since last we met, and one's blood
flowed pink and gold and purple, one's flesh turned
silk, one's eyes onyx, before the wonder of his
narrative.</p>

<p>No one was to be outdone in adventurous recital.
Alrik had spent the summer guiding a party of
amateur sports along the Allagash, and his garbled
account of it would have stocked a comic paper for
a month. The Pretty Lady had christened a warship,
and her eager, brooky voice went rippling and
churtling through such major details as blue chiffon
velvet and the goldiest kind of champagne. Even
Alrik's raw-boned Old Mother, clinking dirty supper
dishes out in the kitchen, had a crackle-voiced
tale of excitement to contribute about a floundering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
spring bear that she had soused with soap-suds from
her woodshed window.</p>

<p>But all the time the storm grew worse and worse.
The poor, tiny old house tore and writhed under
the strain. Now and again a shutter blew shrilly
loose, or a chimney brick thudded down, or a great
sheet of rain sucked itself up like a whirlpool and
then came drenching and hurtling itself in a perfect
frenzy against the frail, clattering window-panes.</p>

<p>It was a good night for four friends to be housed
together in a red, red room, where the low ceiling
brooded over you like a face and the warped floor
curled around you like the cuddle of a hand. A
living-room should always be red, I think, like the
walls of a heart, and cluttered, as Alrik's was, with
every possible object, mean or fine, funny or pathetic,
that typifies the owner's personal experience.</p>

<p>Yet there are people, I suppose, people stuffed
with arts, not hearts, who would have monotoned
Alrik's bright walls a dull brain-gray, ripped down
the furs, the fishing-tackle, the stuffed owls, the
gaudy theatrical posters, the shelf of glasses, the
spooky hair wreaths, the really terrible crayon portrait
of some much-beloved ancient grandame; and,
supplementing it all with a single, homesick Japanese
print, yearning across the vacuum at a chalky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
white bust of a perfect stranger like Psyche or
Ruskin, would have called the whole effect more
"successful." Just as though the crudest possible
room that represents the affections is not infinitely
more worth while than the most esoteric apartment
that represents the intellect.</p>

<p>There were certainly no vacuums in Alrik's room.
Everything in it was crowded and scrunched together
like a hard, friendly hand-shake. It was the
most fiercely, primitively sincere room that I have
ever seen, and king or peasant therefore would have
felt equally at home in it. Surely no mere man
could have crossed the humpy threshold without
a blissful, instinctive desire to keep on his hat and
take off his boots. Alrik knew how to make a room
"homeful." Alrik knew everything in the world
except grammar.</p>

<p>Red warmth, yellow cheer, and all-colored jollity
were there with us.</p>

<p>Faster and faster we talked, and louder and
louder we laughed, until at last, when the conversation
lost its breath utterly, Alrik jumped up with
a grin and started our old friend the phonograph.
His first choice of music was a grotesque <i>duo</i> by
two back-yard cats. It was one of those irresistibly
silly minstrel things that would have exploded
any decent bishop in the midst of his sermon. Certainly
no one of us had ever yet been able to withstand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
it. <i>But now no bristling, injuriated dog
jumped from his sleep and charged like a whole
regiment on the perfectly innocent garden.</i> And
the duo somehow seemed strangely flat.</p>

<p>"Here is something we used to like," suggested
Alrik desperately, and started a splendid barytone
rendering of "Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes."
<i>But no high-pitched, mocking tenor voice took up
the solemn velvet song and flirted it like a cheap
chiffon scarf.</i> And the Pretty Lady rose very suddenly
and went out to the kitchen indefinitely "for
a glass of water." It was funny about the Blue
Serge Man. I had not liked him overmuch, but I
missed <i>not-liking-him</i> with a crick in my heart
that was almost sorrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake try some other music!"
cried the Partridge Hunter venomously, and Alrik
clutched out wildly for the first thing he could
reach. It was "Give My Regards to Broadway."
We had practically worn out the record the year before,
but its mutilated remains whirred along, dropping
an occasional note or word, with the same
cheerful spunk and unconcern that characterized
the song itself:</p>

<div class='unindent'>
"Give my regards to Broadway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Remember me to Herald Square,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Tell all the&mdash;whirry&mdash;whirry, whirrrrry&mdash;whirrrrrrr</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That I will soon be there."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Patridge'">Partridge</ins> Hunter began instantly to beat muffled
time with his soft felt slippers. Alrik plunged
as usual into a fearfully clever and clattery imitation
of an ox shying at a street-car. <i>But what of
it? No wakened, sparkling-eyed girl came stealing
forth from her corner to cuddle her blazing cheek
against the cool, brass-colored jowl of the phonograph
horn.</i> An All-Goneness is an amazing thing.
It was strange about Alrik's Wife. Her presence
had been as negative as a dead gray dove. But her
<i>absence</i> was like scarlet strung with bells!</div>

<p>The evening began to drag out like a tortured
rubber band getting ready to snap.</p>

<p>It was surely eleven o'clock before the Pretty
Lady returned from the kitchen with our hot lemonades.
The tall glasses jingled together pleasantly
on the tray. The height was there, the
breadth, the precious, steaming fragrance. <i>But
the Blue Serge Man had always mixed our nightcaps
for us.</i></p>

<p>With grandiloquent pleasantry, the Partridge
Hunter jumped to his feet, raised his glass, toasted
"Happy Days," choked on the first swallow, bungled
his grasp, and dropped the whole glass in shattering,
messy fragments to the floor.</p>

<p>"Lord," he muttered under his breath, "one
could stand missing a fellow in a church or a graveyard
or a mournful sunset glow&mdash;but to miss him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in a foolish, folksy&mdash;hot lemonade!&mdash;Lord!"
And he shook his shoulders almost angrily and
threw himself down again on the hearth-rug.</p>

<p>The darkening room was warm as an oven now,
and the great, soft, glowing pile of apple-wood embers
lured one's drowsy eyes like a flame-colored
pillow. No one spoke at all until midnight.</p>

<p>But the clock had only just finished complaining
about the hour when the Partridge Hunter straightened
up abruptly and cried out to no one in particular:</p>

<p>"Well, I simply can't bluff this out any longer.
I've just <i>got</i> to know how it all happened!"</p>

<p>No one stopped to question his meaning. No
one stopped to parry with word or phrase. Like
two tense music-boxes wound to their utmost
resonance, but with mechanism only just that instant
released, Alrik and the Pretty Lady burst into
sound.</p>

<p>The Pretty Lady spoke first. Her breath was
short and raspy and cross, like the breath of a person
who runs for a train&mdash;and misses it.</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;in&mdash;Florida," she gasped, "the&mdash;last&mdash;of
March. The sailboat was a dreadful,
flimsy, shattered thing. But he <i>would</i> go out in it&mdash;<i>alone</i>&mdash;storm
or no storm!" She spoke with
a sudden sense of emotional importance, with
a certain strange, fierce, new pride in the shortcomings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of her Man. "He must have swamped within
an hour. They found his boat. But they never
found his body. Just as one could always find his
pocket, but never his watch&mdash;his purse, but never
his money&mdash;his song, but never his soul." Her
broken self-control plunged deeper and deeper into
bitterness. "It was a stupid&mdash;wicked&mdash;wilful&mdash;accident,"
she persisted, "and I can see him in
his last, smothery&mdash;astonished&mdash;moment&mdash;just&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;plainly&mdash;as&mdash;though&mdash;I&mdash;had&mdash;been&mdash;there.
Do you think for an instant that he
would swallow even&mdash;Death&mdash;without making a
fuss about it? Can't you hear him rage and sputter:
'<i>This</i> is too salt! <i>This</i> is too cold! Take it
away and bring me another!' While all the time
his frenzied mind was racing up and down some
precious, memoried playground like the Harvard
Stadium or the New York Hippodrome, whimpering,
'Everybody'll be there except&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;except
<span class="smcap">m-e</span>!'"</p>

<p>The Pretty Lady's voice took on a sudden hurt,
left-out resentment. "Of course," she hurried on,
"he wasn't exactly sad to go&mdash;nothing could
make him sad. But I know that it must have made
him very <i>mad</i>. He had just bought a new automobile.
And he had rented a summer place at
Marblehead. And he wanted to play tennis in
June&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>She paused for an instant's breath, and Alrik
crashed like a moose into the silence.</p>

<p>"It was lung trouble!" he attested vehemently.
"Cough, cough, cough, all the time. It came on
specially worse in April, and she died in May. She
wasn't never very strong, you know, but she'd
been brought up in your wicked old steam-heated
New York, and she would persist in wearing tissue-paper
clothes right through our rotten icy winters
up here. And when I tried to dose her like the
doctor said, with cod-liver oil or any of them thick
things, I couldn't fool her&mdash;she just up an' said it
was nothin' but liquid flannel, and spit it out and
sassed me. And Gruff&mdash;Growly-Dog-Gruff," he
finished hastily, "I don't know what ailed him.
He jus' kind of followed along about June."</p>

<p>The Partridge Hunter drew a long, heavy breath.
When he spoke at last, his voice sounded like the
voice of a man who holds his hat in his hand, and
the puffs of smoke from his pipe made a sort of little
halo round his words.</p>

<p>"Isn't it nice," he mused, "to think that while
we four are cozying here to-night in the same jolly
old haunts, perhaps they three&mdash;Man, Girl, and
Dog&mdash;are cuddling off together somewhere in the
big, spooky Unknown, in the shade of a cloud, or
the shine of a star&mdash;talking&mdash;perhaps&mdash;about&mdash;<i>us?</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The whimsical comfort of the thought pleased
me. I did not want any one to be alone on such a
night.</p>

<p>But Alrick's tilted chair came crashing down on
the floor with a resounding whack. His eyes were
blazing.</p>

<p>"She <i>ain't</i> with him!" he cried. "She <i>ain't</i>,
she <span class="smcap">ain't</span>, she A-I-N-'T! I won't have it. Why,
it's the middle of the night!"</p>

<p>And in that electric instant I saw the Pretty
Lady's face set rigidly, all except her mouth, which
twisted in my direction.</p>

<p>"I'll wager she <i>is</i> with him," she whispered under
her breath. "She always did tag him wherever
he went!"</p>

<p>Then I felt the toe of my slipper meet the recumbent
elbow of the Partridge Hunter. Had I
reached out to him? Or had he reached back to
me? There was no time to find out, for the
smooth, round conversation shattered prickingly in
the hand like a blown-glass bauble, and with much
nervous laughter and far-fetched joke-making, we
rose, rummaged round for our candles, and climbed
upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>Alrik's Old Mother burrowed into a corner under
the eaves.</p>

<p>The Pretty Lady had her usual room, and mine
was next to hers. For a lingering moment I dallied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
with her, craving some tiny, absurd bit of loving
service. First, I helped her with a balky hook on
her collar. Then I started to put her traveling
coat and hat away in the closet. On the upper shelf
something a little bit scary brushed my hands. <i>It
was the Blue Serge Man's cap, with a ragged gash
across it where Growly-Dog-Gruff had worried it
on a day I remembered well.</i> With a hurried
glance over my shoulder to make sure that the
Pretty Lady had not also spied it, I reached up and
shoved it&mdash;oh, 'way, 'way back out of sight, where
no one but a detective or a lover could possibly
find it.</p>

<p>Then I hurried off to my room with a most garish
human wonder: How could a <i>man</i> be all gone,
but his silly cap <i>last?</i></p>

<p>My little room was just as I remembered it, bare,
bleak, and gruesomely clean, with a rag rug, a
worsted motto, and a pink china vase for really
sensuous ornamentation. I opened the cheap pine
bureau to stow away my things. <i>A trinket jingled&mdash;a
tawdry rhinestone side-comb. Caught in the
setting was a tiny wisp of brown hair.</i> I slammed
the drawer with a bang, and opened another.
<i>Metal and leather slid heavily along the bottom.</i>
It might have been my beast's collar, if distinctly
across the name-plate had not run the terse phrase
"Alrik's Cross Dog." I did not like to have my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
bureau haunted! When I slammed that drawer, it
cracked the looking-glass.</p>

<p>Then, with candle burning just as cheerfully as
possible, I lay down on the bed in all my clothes
and began to <i>wake up</i>&mdash;wider and wider and
wider.</p>

<p>My reason lay quite dormant like some drugged
thing but my memory, photographic as a lens, began
to reproduce the ruddy, blond face of the Blue
Serge Man beaming across a chafing-dish; the
mournful, sobbing sound of a dog's dream; the
crisp, starched, Monday smell of the blue gingham
aprons that Alrik's Wife used to wear. The vision
was altogether too vivid to be pleasant.</p>

<p>Then the wet wind blew in through the window
like a splash of alcohol, chilling, revivifying, stinging
as a whip-lash. The tormented candle flame
struggled furiously for a moment, and went out,
hurtling the black night down upon me like some
choking avalanche of horror. In utter idiotic
panic I jumped from my bed and clawed my way
toward the feeble gray glow of the window-frame.
The dark dooryard before me was drenched with
rain. The tall linden trees waved and mourned in
the wind.</p>

<p>"Of course, of course, there are no ghosts," I
reasoned, just as one reasons that there is no mistake
in the dictionary, no flaw in the multiplication<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
table. But sometimes one's fantastically jaded
nerves think they have found the blunder in language,
the fault in science. Ghosts or no ghosts&mdash;if
you <i>thought</i> you saw one, wouldn't it be just
as bad? My eyes strained out into the darkness.
Suppose&mdash;I&mdash;should&mdash;<i>think</i>&mdash;that I heard the
bark of a dog? Suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;that from
that black shed door where the automobile used to
live, I should <i>think</i>&mdash;even <span class="smcap">t-h-i-n-k</span> that I saw
the Blue Serge Man come stumbling with a lantern?
The black shed door burst open with a bang-bang-bang,
and I screamed, jumped, snatched a blanket,
and fled for the lamp-lighted hall.</p>

<p>A little dazzled by the sudden glow, I shrank
back in alarm from a figure on the top stair. It
was the Pretty Lady. Wrapped clumsily like myself
in a big blanket, she sat huddled there with the
kerosene lamp close beside her, mending the Blue
Serge Man's cap. On the step below her, smothered
in a soggy lavender comforter, crouched Alrik's
Old Mother, her dim eyes brightened uncannily
with superstitious excitement. I was evidently
a welcome addition to the party, and the old woman
cuddled me in like a meal-sack beside her.</p>

<p>"Naw one could sleep a night like this," she
croaked.</p>

<p>"<i>Sleep?</i>" gasped the Pretty Lady. Scorn infinite
was in her tone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>But comfortably and serenely from the end of
the hall came the heavy, regular breathing of the
Partridge Hunter, and from beyond that, Alrik's
blissful, oblivious snore. Yet Alrik was the only
one among us who claimed an agonizing, personal
sorrow.</p>

<p>I began to laugh a bit hysterically. "Men are
funny people," I volunteered.</p>

<p>Alrik's Old Mother caught my hand with a
chuckle, then sobered suddenly, and shook her
wadded head.</p>

<p>"Men <i>ain't</i> exactly&mdash;people," she confided.
"Men <i>ain't</i> exactly people&mdash;at all!"</p>

<p>The conviction evidently burned dull, steady,
comforting as a night-light, in the old crone's eighty
years' experience, but the Pretty Lady's face
grabbed the new idea desperately, as though she
were trying to rekindle happiness with a wet match.
Yet every time her fretted lips straightened out in
some semblance of Peace, her whole head would
suddenly explode in one gigantic sneeze. There
was no other sound, I remember, for hours and
hours, except the steady, monotonous, slobbery
swash of a bursting roof-gutter somewhere close in
the eaves.</p>

<p>Certainly Dawn itself was not more chilled and
gray than we when we crept back at last to our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
beds, thick-eyed with drowsy exhaustion, limp-bodied,
muffle-minded.</p>

<p>But when we woke again, the late, hot noonday
sun was like a scorching fire in our faces, and the
drenched dooryard steamed like a dye-house in the
sudden burst of unseasonable heat.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the Pretty Lady, in her hundred-dollar
ruffles, went out to the barn with shabby
Alrik to help him mend a musty old plow harness.
The Pretty Lady's brains were almost entirely in
her fingers. So were Alrik's. The exclusiveness
of their task seemed therefore to thrust the Partridge
Hunter and me off by ourselves into a sort of
amateur sorrow class, and we started forth as cheerfully
as we could to investigate the autumn woods.</p>

<p>Passing the barn door, we heard the strident
sound of Alrik's complaining. Braced with his
heavy shoulders against a corner of the stall, he
stood hurling down his new-born theology upon
the glossy blond head of the Pretty Lady who sat
perched adroitly on a nail keg with two shiny-tipped
fingers prying up the corners of her mouth
into a smile. One side of the smile was distinctly
wry. But Alrik's face was deadly earnest. Sweat
bubbled out on his forehead like tears that could not
possibly wait to reach his eyes.</p>

<p>"There ought to be a separate heaven for ladies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and gentlemen," he was arguing frantically.
"'Tain't fair. 'Tain't right. I won't have it!
I'll see a priest. I'll find a parson. If it ain't
proper to live with people, it ain't proper to die
with 'em. I tell you I won't have Amy careerin'
round with strange men. She always was foolish
about men. And I'm breakin' my heart for her,
and Mother's gettin' old, and the house is goin'
to rack and ruin, but how&mdash;<i>how</i> can a man go and
get married comfortable again when his mind's all
torturin' round and round and round about his first
wife?"</p>

<p>The Partridge Hunter gave a sharp laugh under
his breath, yet he did not seem exactly amused.
"Laugh for <i>two!</i>" I suggested, as we dodged out
of sight round the corner and plunged off into the
actual Outdoors.</p>

<p>The heat was really intense, the October sun
dazzlingly bright. Warmth steamed from the earth,
and burnished from the sky. A plushy brown rabbit
lolling across the roadway dragged on one's
sweating senses like overshoes in June. Under our
ruthless, heavy-booted feet the wet green meadow
winced like some tender young salad. At the edge
of the forest the big pines darkened sumptuously.
Then, suddenly, between a scarlet sumach and a slim
white birch, the cavernous wood-path opened forth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
mysteriously, narrow and tall and domed like the
arch of a cathedral. Not a bird twitted, not a leaf
rustled, and, far as the eye could reach, the wet
brown pine-needles lay thick and soft and padded
like tan-bark, as though all Nature waited hushed
and expectant for some exquisitely infinitesimal
tragedy, like the travail of a squirrel.</p>

<p>With brain and body all a-whisper and a-tiptoe,
the Partridge Hunter and I stole deeper and deeper
into the Color and the Silence and the Witchery,
dazed at every step by the material proof of autumn
warring against the spiritual insistence of
spring. It was the sort of day to make one very
tender toward the living just because they were living,
and very tender toward the dead just because
they were dead.</p>

<p>At the gurgling bowl of a half-hidden spring,
we made our first stopping-place. Out of his generous
corduroy pockets the Partridge Hunter
tinkled two drinking-cups, dipped them deep in the
icy water, and handed me one with a little shuddering
exclamation of cold. For an instant his eyes
searched mine, then he lifted his cup very high and
stared off into <i>Nothingness</i>.</p>

<p>"To the&mdash;<i>All-Gone People</i>," he toasted.</p>

<p>I began to cry. He seemed very glad to have me
cry. "Cry for two," he suggested blithely, "cry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
for two," and threw himself down on the twiggy
ground and began to snap metallically against the
cup in his hand.</p>

<p>"Nice little tin cup," he affirmed judicially.
"The Blue Serge Man gave it to me. It must
have cost as much as fifteen cents. And it will
last, I suppose, till the moon is mud and the stars
are dough. But the Blue Serge Man himself is&mdash;quite
<i>gone</i>. Funny idea!" The Partridge Hunter's
forehead began to knit into a fearful frown.
"Of course it <i>isn't</i> so," he argued, "but it would
certainly seem sometimes as though a man's <i>things</i>
were the only really immortal, indestructible part
of him, and that Soul was nothing in the world but
just a composite name for the S-ouvenirs, O-rnaments,
U-tensils, L-itter that each man's personality
accumulates in the few years' time allotted to
him. The man himself, you see, is wiped right off
the earth like a chalk-mark, but you can't escape or
elude in a million years the wizened bronze elephant
that he brought home from India, or the showy
red necktie that's down behind his bureau, or the
floating, wind-blown, ash-barrel bill for violets that
turns up a generation hence in a German prayer-book
at a French book-stall.</p>

<p>"And isn't Death a teasing teacher? Holds up
a personality suddenly like a map&mdash;makes you
learn by heart every possible, conceivable pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
detail concerning that personality, and then, when
you are fairly bursting with your happy knowledge,
tears up the map in your face and says, 'There's no
such country any more, so what you've learned
won't do you the slightest good.' And there you'd
only just that moment found out that your friend's
hair was a beautiful auburn instead of 'a horrid
red'; that his blessed old voice was hearty, not
'noisy'; that his table manners were quaint, not
'queer'; that his morals were broad, not 'bad.'"</p>

<p>The Partridge Hunter's mouth began to twist.
"It's a horrid thing to say," he stammered, "but
there ought to be a sample shroud in every home,
so that when your husband is late to dinner, or
your daughter smokes a cigarette, or your son decides
to marry the cook, you could get out the
shroud and try it on the offender, and make a few
experiments concerning&mdash;well, <i>values</i>. Why, I
saw a man last week dragged by a train&mdash;jerked
in and out and over and under, with his head or his
heels or the hem of his coat just missing Death
every second by the hundred-millionth fraction of
an inch. But when he was rescued at last and went
home to dinner&mdash;shaken as an aspen, sicker than
pulp, tongue-tied like a padlock&mdash;I suppose, very
likely, his wife scolded him for having forgotten the
oysters."</p>

<p>The Partridge Hunter's face flushed suddenly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't care much for Alrik's Wife," he attested
abruptly. "I always thought she was a
trivial, foolish little crittur. But if I had known
that I was never going to see her again&mdash;while the
sun blazed or the stars blinked&mdash;I should like to
have gone back from the buckboard that last morning
and stroked her brown hair just once away from
her eyes. Does that seem silly to you?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," I said. "It doesn't seem silly at
all. If I had guessed that the Blue Serge Man
was going off on such a long, long, never-stop journey,
I might even have kissed him good-by. But
I certainly can't imagine anything that would have
provoked or astonished him more! People can't
go round petting one another just on the possible
chance of never meeting again. And goodness
gracious! nobody wants to. It's only that when
a person actually <i>dies</i>, a sort of subtle, holy sense
in you wakes up and wishes that just once for all
eternity it might have gotten a signal through to
that subtle, holy sense in the other person. And
of course when a youngster dies, you feel somehow
that he or she must have been different all
along from other people, and you simply wish that
you might have guessed that fact sooner&mdash;before
it was too late."</p>

<p>The Partridge Hunter began to smile. "If you
knew," he teased, "that I was going to be massacred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
by an automobile or crumpled by an elevator
before next October&mdash;would you wish that you
had petted me just a little to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I acknowledged.</p>

<p>The Partridge Hunter pretended he was deaf.
"Say that once again," he begged.</p>

<p>"Y-e-s," I repeated.</p>

<p>The Partridge Hunter put back his head and
roared. "That's just about like kissing through
the telephone," he said. "It isn't particularly satisfying,
and yet it makes a desperately cunning
sound."</p>

<p>Then I put back my head and laughed, too, because
it is so thoroughly comfortable and pleasant
to be friends for only one single week in all the
year. Independence is at best such a scant fabric,
and every new friendship you incur takes just one
more tuck in that fabric, till before you know it
your freedom is quite too short to go out in. The
Partridge Hunter felt exactly the same way about
it, and after each little October playtime we ripped
out the thread with never a scar to show.</p>

<p>Even now while we laughed, we thought we
might as well laugh at everything we could think
of, and get just that much finished and out of the
way.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the Partridge Hunter, "perhaps
the Blue Serge Man was <i>glad</i> to see Amy, and perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
he was rattled, no one can tell. But I'll wager
anything he was awfully mad to see Gruff. There
were lots of meteors last June, I remember. I understand
now. It was the Blue Serge Man raking
down the stars to pelt at Gruff."</p>

<p>"Gruff was a very&mdash;nice dog," I insisted.</p>

<p>"He was a very growly dog," acceded the Partridge
Hunter.</p>

<p>"If you growl all the time, it's almost the same
as a purr," I argued.</p>

<p>The Partridge Hunter smiled a little, but not
very generously. Something was on his mind.
"Poor little Amy," he said. "Any man-and-woman
game is playing with fire, but it's foolish to
think that there are only two kinds, just Hearth-Fire
and Hell-Fire. Why, there's 'Student-lamp'
and 'Cook-stove' and 'Footlights.' Amy and the
Blue Serge Man were playing with 'Footlights,' I
guess. She needed an audience. And he was New
York to her, great, blessed, shiny, rackety New
York. I believe she loved Alrik. He must have
been a pretty picturesque figure on that first and
only time when he blazed his trail down Broadway.
But <i>happy</i> with him&mdash;<span class="smcap">h-e-r-e</span>? Away from New
York? Five years? In just green and brown
woods where the posies grow on the ground instead
of on hats, and even the Christmas trees are
trimmed with nothing except real snow and live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
squirrels? <span class="smcap">G-l-o-r-y!</span> Of course her chest caved
in. There wasn't kinky air enough in the whole
state of Maine to keep her kind of lungs active.
Of course she starved to death. She needed her
meat flavored with harp and violin; her drink
aerated with electric lights. We might have done
something for her if we'd liked her just a little bit
better. But I didn't even know her till I heard that
she was dead."</p>

<p>He jumped up suddenly and helped me to my
feet. Something in my face must have stricken
him. "Would you like my warm hand to walk
home with?" he finished quite abruptly.</p>

<p>Even as he offered it, one of those chill, quick
autumn changes came over the October woods. The
sun grayed down behind huge, windy clouds. The
leaves began to shiver and shudder and chatter,
and all the gorgeous reds and greens dulled out of
the world, leaving nothing as far as the eye could
reach but dingy squirrel-colors, tawny grays and
dusty yellows, with the far-off, panting sound of a
frightened brook dodging zigzag through some
meadow in a last, desperate effort to escape winter.
As a draft from a tomb the cold, clammy, valley
twilight was upon us.</p>

<p>Like two bashful children scuttling through a
pantomime, we hurried out of the glowery, darkening
woods, and then at the edge of the meadow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
broke into a wild, mirthful race for Alrik's bright
hearth-fire, which glowed and beckoned from his
windows like a little tame, domesticated sunset.
The Partridge Hunter cleared the porch steps at
a single bound, but I fell flat on the bruising doormat.</p>

<p>Nothing really mattered, however, except the
hearth-fire itself.</p>

<p>Alrik and the Pretty Lady were already there
before us, kneeling down with giggly, scorching
faces before a huge corn-popper foaming white
with little muffled, ecstatic notes of heat and
harvest.</p>

<p>The Pretty Lady turned a crimson cheek to us,
and Alrik's tanned skin glowed like a freshly shellacked
Indian. Even the Old Mother's asthmatic
breath purred from the jogging rocker like a specially
contented pussy-cat.</p>

<p>Nothing in all the room, I remember, looked
pallid or fretted except the great, ghastly white
face of the clock. I despise a clock that looks worried.
It wasn't late, anyway. It was scarcely
quarter-past four.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was only half-past four when the company
came. We were making such a racket among
ourselves that our very first warning was the sudden,
blunt, rubbery <i>m-o-o</i> of an automobile directly
outside. Mud was the first thing I thought of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the door flew open peremptorily, and there
on the threshold stood the Blue Serge Man&mdash;not
dank and wet with slime and seaweed, but fat and
ruddy and warm in a huge gray 'possum coat. Only
the fearful, stilted immovability of him gave the
lie to his reality.</p>

<p><i>It was a miracle!</i> I had always wondered a great
deal about miracles. I had always longed, craved,
prayed to experience a miracle. I had always supposed
that a miracle was the supreme sensation of
existence, the ultimate rapture of the soul. But it
seems I was mistaken. A miracle doesn't do anything
to your soul for days and days and days. Your
heart, of course, may jump, and your blood foam,
but first of all it simply makes you very, very sick in
the pit of your stomach. It made a man like Alrik
clutch at his belt and jump up and down and "holler"
like a lunatic. It smote the Partridge Hunter
somewhere between a cramp and a sob. It ripped
the Old Mother close at her waist-line, and raveled
her out on the floor like a fluff of gray yarn.</p>

<p>But the Pretty Lady just stood up with her hands
full of pop-corn, and stared and stared and stared
and <span class="smcap">stared</span>. From her shining blond head to
her jet-black slippers she was like an exploded
pulse.</p>

<p>The Blue Serge Man stepped forward into the
room and faltered. In that instant's faltering,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Alrik jumped for him like a great, glad, loving dog,
and ripped the coat right off his shoulders.</p>

<p>The Blue Serge Man's lips were all a-grin, but
a scar across his forehead gave a certain tense,
stricken dignity to his eyes. Very casually, very
indolently, he began to tug at his gloves, staring all
the while with malevolent joy on the fearful crayon
portrait of the ancient grandame.</p>

<p>"That's the very last face I thought of when I
was drowning," he drawled, "and there wasn't
room enough in all heaven for the two of us. Bully
old face, I'm glad I'm here. I've been in Cuba,"
he continued quite abruptly, "and I meant to play
dead forever and ever. But there was an autumn
leaf&mdash;a red autumn leaf in a lady's hat&mdash;and it
made me homesick." His voice broke suddenly,
and he turned to his wife with quick, desperate,
pleading intensity. "I'm not&mdash;much&mdash;good,"
he gasped. "But I've&mdash;<i>come back!</i>"</p>

<p>I saw the flaky white pop-corn go trickling
through the Pretty Lady's fingers, but she just stood
there and shook and writhed like a tightly wrung
newspaper smoldering with fire. Then her face
flamed suddenly with a light I had never, never
seen since my world was made.</p>

<p>"I don't care whether you're any good or
not," she cried. "You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're <i>alive!</i> You're&mdash;<span class="smcap">alive</span>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought she would never stop saying it, on and
on and on and on. "You're alive, you're alive,
you're alive." Like a defective phonograph disk
her shattered sense caught on that one supreme
phrase, "You're alive! You're alive! You're
alive! You're alive!"</p>

<p>Then the blood that had blazed in her face spread
suddenly to her nerveless hands, and she began to
pluck at the crape ruffles on her gown. Stitch by
stitch I heard the rip-rip-rip like the buzz of a fishing-reel.
But louder than all came that maddening,
monotonous cry, "You're alive! You're
alive! You're alive!" I thought her brain was
broken.</p>

<p>Then the Blue Serge Man sprang toward her,
and I shut my eyes. But I caught the blessed,
clumsy sound of a lover's boot tripping on a ruffle&mdash;the
crushing out of a breath&mdash;the smother of a
half-lipped word.</p>

<p>I don't know what became of Alrik. I don't
know what became of Alrik's Old Mother. But
the Partridge Hunter, with his arm across his eyes,
came groping for me through the red, red room.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of this," he whispered. "Let's
get out of this."</p>

<p>So once again, amateurs both in sorrow and in
gladness, the Partridge Hunter and I fled fast before
the Incomprehensible. Out we ran through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Amy's frost-blighted rose-garden, <i>where no gay,
shrill young voice challenged our desecration</i>, out
through the senile old apple orchard, <i>where no suspicious
dog came bristling forth to question our
innocent intrusion</i>, up through the green-ribbon
roadway, up through the stumbling wood-path, to
the safe, sound, tangible, moss-covered pasture-bars,
where the warm, brown-fur bossies, sweet-breathed
and steaming, came lolling gently down
through the gauzy dusk to barter their pleasant
milk for a snug night's lodging and a troughful of
yellow mush.</p>

<p>A dozen mysterious wood-folk crackled close
within reach, as though all the little day-animals
were laying aside their starched clothes for the
night; and the whole earth teemed with the exquisite,
sleepy, nestling-down sound of fur and
feathers and tired leaves. Out in the forest depths
somewhere a belated partridge drummed out his excuses.
Across on the nearest stone wall a tawny
marauder went hunching his way along. It might
have been a fox, it might have been Amy's thrown-away
coon-cat. Short and sharp from the house
behind us came the fast, furious crash of Alrik's
frenzied young energies, chopping wood enough to
warm a dozen houses for a dozen winters for a
dozen new brides. But high above even the racket
of his ax rang the sweet, wild, triumphant resonance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of some French Canadian <i>chanson</i>. His heart
and his lungs seemed fairly to have exploded in
relief.</p>

<p>And over the little house, and the dark woods,
and the mellow pasture, and the brown-fur bossies,
broke a little, wee, tiny prick-point of a star, as
though some Celestial Being were peeping down
whimsically to see just what the Partridge Hunter
and I thought of it all.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE AMATEUR LOVER</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/drop_w.png" width="165" height="164" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />ITH every night piercing her like
a new wound, and every morning
stinging her like salt in that
wound, Ruth Dudley's broken
engagement had dragged itself
out for four long, hideous
months. There's so much fever in a woman's
sorrow.</div>

<p>At first, to be sure, there had been no special
outward and visible sign of heartbreak except the
thunderstorm shadows under the girl's blue eyes.
Then, gradually, very gradually, those same plucky
eyes had dulled and sickened as though every individual
thought in her brain was festering. Later,
an occasional loosened finger ring had clattered off
into her untouched plate or her reeking strong cup
of coffee. At the end of the fourth month the
family doctor was quite busy attesting that she had
no tubercular trouble of any sort. There never yet
was any stethoscope invented that could successfully
locate consumption of the affections.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Ruth's Big Brother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
strolling smokily into her room one evening, jumped
back in tragic dismay at the astonishing sight that
met his eyes. There, like some fierce young sacrificial
priestess, with a very modern smutty nose and
scorched cheeks, Ruth knelt on the hearth-rug, slamming
every conceivable object that she could reach
into the blazing fire. The soft green walls of the
room were utterly stripped and ravished. The floor
in every direction lay cluttered deep with books and
pictures and clothes and innumerable small bits of
bric-a-brac. Already the brimming fireplace leaked
forth across the carpet in little gray, gusty flakes of
ash and cinder.</p>

<p>The Big Brother hooted right out loud. "Why,
Ruthy Dudley," he gasped. "What <i>are</i> you doing?
You look like the devil!"</p>

<p>Blissfully unconscious of smoke or smut, the girl
pushed back the straggling blond hair from her
eyes and grinned, with her white teeth shot like a
bolt through her under lip to keep the grin in place.</p>

<p>"I'm not a 'devil,'" she explained. "I'm a
god! And what am I doing? I'm creating a new
heaven and a new earth."</p>

<p>"You won't have much left to create it with,"
scoffed the Big Brother, kicking the tortured wreck
of a straw hat farther back into the flames.</p>

<p>The girl reached up impatiently and smutted her
other hand across her eyes. "Nothing left to create<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
it with?" she mocked. "Why, if I had anything
left to create it with, I'd be only a&mdash;mechanic!"</p>

<p>Then, blackened like a coal-heaver and tousled
like a Skye terrier, she picked up the scarlet bellows
and commenced to pump a savage yellow flame into
a writhing, half-charred bundle of letters.</p>

<p>Through all the sweet, calm hours of that warm
June night the sacrifice progressed with amazing
rapacity. By midnight she had just finished stirring
the fire-tongs through the ghostly, lacelike ashes of
her wedding gown. At two o'clock her violin went
groaning into the flames. At three her Big Brother,
yawning sleepily back in his nightclothes, picked her
up bodily and dumped her into her bed. He was
very angry. "Little Sister," he scolded, "there's
no man living worth the fuss you're making over
Aleck Reese!" And the little sister sat up and
rubbed her smutty, scorched cheek against his cool,
blue-shaven face as she tilted the drifting ashes
from the bedspread. "I'm not making any
'fuss,'" she protested. "I'm only just&mdash;burning
my bridges." It was the first direct allusion that
she had ever made to her trouble.</p>

<p>Twice after that&mdash;between three o'clock and
breakfast time&mdash;the Big Brother woke from his
sleep with a horrid sense that the house was on fire.
Twice between three o'clock and breakfast time he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
met the Housekeeper scuttling along the halls on the
same sniffy errand. Once with a flickering candle-light
Ruth herself crept out to the doorway and
laughed at them. "The house isn't on fire, you
sillies," she cried. "Don't you know a burnt bridge
when you smell it?" But the doctor had said quite
distinctly: "You must watch that little girl. Sorrow
in the tongue will talk itself cured, if you give
it a chance; but sorrow in the eyes has a wicked,
wicked way now and then of leaking into the
brain."</p>

<p>It was the Housekeeper, though, whose eyes
looked worried and tortured at breakfast time. It
was the Big Brother's face that showed a bit sharp
on the cheek-bones. Ruth herself, for the first time
in a listless, uncollared, unbelted, unstarched month,
came frisking down to the table as white and fresh
and crisp as linen and starch and curls could make
her.</p>

<p>"I'm going to town this morning," she announced
nonchalantly to her relieved and delighted
hearers. The eyes that turned to her brother's were
almost mischievous. "Couldn't you meet me at
twelve o'clock," she suggested, "and take me off to
the shore somewhere for lunch? I'll be shopping
on Main Street about that time, so suppose I meet
you at Andrew Bernard's office."</p>

<p>Half an hour later she was stealing out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
creaky back door into the garden, along the gray,
pebbly gravel walk between the tall tufts of crimson
and purple phlox, to the little gay-faced plot
of heart's-ease where the family doctor, symbolist
and literalist, had bade her dig and delve every day
in the good, hot, wholesome, freckly sunshine.
Close by in the greensward an absurd pet lamb was
tugging and bouncing at the end of its stingy tether.
In a moment's time the girl had transferred the
clumsy iron tether-stake to the midst of her posy
bed. Then she started for the gate.</p>

<p>Pausing for just one repentant second with her
hand on the gate latch, she turned and looked back
to the ruthlessly trodden spot where the bland-eyed
lamb stood eyeing her quizzically with his soft,
woolly mouth fairly dripping with the tender, precious
blossoms. "Heart's-ease. B-a-a!" mocked
the girl, with a flicker of real amusement.
"Heart's-ease. B-a-a-a!" scoffed the lamb, just
because his stomach and his tongue happened to be
made like that. Then with a quick dodge across
the lane she ran to meet the electric car and started
off triumphantly for the city, shutting her faint eyes
resolutely away from all the roadside pools and
ponds and gleams of river whose molten, ultimate
peace possibilities had lured her sick mind so incessantly
for the past dozen weeks.</p>

<p>Two hours later, with a hectic spurt of energy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
she was racing up three winding, dizzy flights of
stairs in a ponderous, old-fashioned office building.</p>

<p>Before a door marked "Andrew Bernard, Attorney
at Law," she stopped and waited a frightened
moment for breath and courage. As though the
pounding of her heart had really sounded as loud
as it felt, the door handle turned abruptly, and a
very tall, broad-shouldered, grave-faced young man
greeted her with attractive astonishment.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Drew," she began politely.
"Why, I haven't seen you for a year." Then,
with alarming vehemence, she finished: "Are you
all alone? I want to talk with you."</p>

<p>Her breathlessness, her embarrassment, her fragile
intensity sobered the young man instantly as he
led her into his private office and stood for a moment
staring inquiringly into her white face. Her mouth
was just as he had last seen it a year ago, fresh and
whimsical and virginal as a child's; but her eyes
were scorched and dazed like the eyes of a shipwreck
survivor or any other person who has been
forced unexpectedly to stare upon life's big emotions
with the naked eye.</p>

<p>"I hear you've been ill this spring," he began
gently. "If you wanted to talk with me, Ruthy,
why didn't you let me come out to the house and
see you? Wouldn't it have been easier?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head. "No," she protested, "I
wanted to come here. What I've got to talk about
is very awkward, and if things get too awkward&mdash;why,
an embarrassed guest has so much better
chance to escape than an embarrassed host." She
struggled desperately to smile, but her lips twittered
instead into a frightened quiver. With narrowing
eyes the young man drew out his big leather chair
for her. Then he perched himself on the corner of
his desk and waited for her to speak.</p>

<p>"Ruthy dear," he smiled, "what's the trouble?
Come, tell your old chum all about it."</p>

<p>The girl scrunched her eyes up tight, like a person
who starts to jump and doesn't care where he
lands. Twice her lips opened and shut without a
sound. Then suddenly she braced herself with an
intense effort.</p>

<p>"Drew," she blurted out, "do you remember&mdash;three
years ago&mdash;you asked me to&mdash;marry&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>"Do I remember it?" gasped Drew. The edgy
sharpness of his tone made the girl open her eyes
and stare at him. "Yes," he acknowledged, "I
remember it."</p>

<p>The girl began to smooth her white skirts with
excessive precision across her knees. "What made
you&mdash;ask me?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"What made me ask you?" cried the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"What made me ask you? Why, I asked you because
I love you."</p>

<p>The girl bent forward anxiously as though she
were deaf. "You asked me because&mdash;<i>what?</i>"
she quizzed him.</p>

<p>"Because I love you," he repeated.</p>

<p>She jumped up suddenly and ran across the room
to him. "Because you&mdash;love me?" she reiterated.
"'Love?' Not 'loved'? Not past tense? Not
all over and done with?"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking her meaning. But the
man's face did not kindle, except with pain. Almost
roughly he put his hands on her shoulders and
searched down deep into her eyes. "Ruth," he
probed, "what are you trying to do to me? Open
an old wound? You know I&mdash;love you."</p>

<p>The girl's mouth smiled, but her eyes blurred wet
with fright and tears.</p>

<p>"Would you care anything&mdash;about&mdash;marrying
me&mdash;now?" she faltered.</p>

<p>Drew's face blanched utterly, and the change gave
him such a horridly foreign, alien look that the girl
drew away from his hands and scuttled back to the
big chair, and began all over again to smooth and
smooth the garish white skirt across her knees.
"Oh, Drew, Drew," she pleaded, "please look like&mdash;<i>you</i>.
Please&mdash;please&mdash;don't look like anybody
else."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>But Drew did not smile at her. He just stood
there and stared in a puzzled, tortured sort of way.</p>

<p>"What about Aleck Reese?" he began with
fierce abruptness.</p>

<p>The girl met the question with unwonted flippancy.
"I've broken my engagement to Aleck
Reese," she said coolly. "Broken it all to smash."</p>

<p>But the latent tremor in her voice did not satisfy
the man. "Why did you break it?" he insisted.
"Isn't Aleck Reese the man you want?"</p>

<p>Her eyes wavered and fell, and then rallied suddenly
to Drew's utmost question.</p>

<p>"Yes, Drew," she answered ingenuously, "Aleck
Reese <i>is</i> the man I want, <i>but he's not the kind of
man I want!</i>" As the telltale sentence left her lips,
every atom of strength wilted out of her, and she
sank back into her chair all sick and faint and shuddery.</p>

<p>The impulsive, bitter laugh died dumb on Drew's
lips. Instantly he was at her side, gentle, patient,
compassionate, the man whom she knew so well.
"Do you mean," he stammered in a startled sort of
way, "do you mean that&mdash;love or no love&mdash;I, I
am the kind of man that you do want?"</p>

<p>Her hand stole shyly into his and she nodded her
head. But her eyes were turned away from him.</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second he wondered just
what the future would hold for him and her if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
should snatch the situation into his arms and crush
her sorrow out against his breast. Then in that
second's hesitancy she shook her hair out of her eyes
and looked up at him like a sick, wistful child.</p>

<p>"Oh, Drew," she pleaded, "you've never, never
failed me yet&mdash;all my hard lessons, all my Fourth-of-July
accidents, all my broken sleds and lost skates.
Couldn't you help me now we're grown up? I'm
so unhappy."</p>

<p>The grimness came back to Drew's face.</p>

<p>"Has Aleck Reese been mean to you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Her eyebrows lifted in denial. "Oh, no&mdash;not
specially," she finished a trifle wearily. "I simply
made up my mind at last that I didn't want to marry
him."</p>

<p>Drew's frown relaxed. "Then what's the trouble?"
he suggested.</p>

<p>Her eyebrows arched again. "What's the trouble?"
she queried. "Why, I happen to love him.
That's all."</p>

<p>She took her hand away from Drew and began to
smooth her skirt once more.</p>

<p>"Yes," she repeated slowly, "as long ago as last
winter I made up my mind that I didn't want to
marry him&mdash;but I didn't make up my courage until
Spring. My courage, I think, is just about six
months slower than my mind. And then, too, my
'love-margin' wasn't quite used up, I suppose. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
woman usually has a 'love-margin,' you know, and,
besides, there's always so much more impetus in a
woman's love. Even though she's hurt, even
though she's heartbroken, even though, worst of
all, she's a tiny bit bored, all her little, natural love
courtesies go on just the same of their own momentum,
for a day or a week, or a month, or half
a lifetime, till the love-flame kindles again&mdash;or else
goes out altogether. Love has to be like that. But
if I were a man, Drew, I'd be awfully careful that
that love-margin didn't ever get utterly exhausted.
Aleck, though, doesn't understand about such
things. I smoothed his headaches just as well, and
listened to his music just as well, so he shiftlessly
took it for granted that I loved him just as well.
What nonsense! 'Love?'" Her voice rose almost
shrilly. "'Love?' Bah! What's love, anyway,
but a wicked sort of hypnotism in the way that a
mouth slants, or a cheek curves, or a lock of hair
colors? Listen to me. If Aleck Reese were a
woman and I were a man, I certainly wouldn't
choose his type for a sweetheart&mdash;irritable, undomestic,
wild for excitement. How's that for a
test? And if Aleck Reese and I were both women,
I certainly shouldn't want him for my friend.
Oughtn't that to decide it? Not a vital taste in
common, not a vital interest, not a vital ideal!"</p>

<p>She began to laugh hysterically. "And I can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
sleep at night for remembering the droll little way
that his hair curls over his forehead, or the hurt, surprised
look in his eyes when he ever really did get
sorry about anything. My God! Drew, look at
me!" she cried, and rolled up her sleeves to her
elbow. The flesh was gone from her as though a
fever had wasted her.</p>

<p>The muscles in Drew's throat began to twitch unpleasantly.
"Was Aleck Reese mean to you?" he
persisted doggedly.</p>

<p>A little faint, defiant smile flickered across her
lips. "Never mind, Drew," she said, "whether
Aleck Reese was mean to me or not. It really
doesn't matter. It doesn't really matter at all
just exactly what a man does or doesn't do
to a woman as long as, by one route or another,
before her wedding day, he brings her to the
place where she can honestly say in her heart,
'This man that I want is not the kind of man that
I want.' Honor, loyalty, strength, gentleness&mdash;why,
Drew, the man I marry has <i>got</i> to be the kind
of man I want.</p>

<p>"I've tried to be fair to Aleck," she mused almost
tenderly. "I've tried to remember always
that men are different from women, and that Aleck
perhaps is different from most men. I've tried to
remember always that he is a musician&mdash;a real,
real musician with all the ghastly, agonizing extremes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of temperament. I've tried to remember
always that he didn't grow up here with us in our
little town with all our fierce, little-town standards,
but that he was educated abroad, that his whole
moral, mental, and social ideals are different, that
the admiration and adulation of&mdash;new&mdash;women
is like the breath of life to him&mdash;that he simply
couldn't live without it any more than I could live
without the love of animals, or the friendship of
children, or the wonderfulness of outdoors, all of
which bore <i>him</i> to distraction.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've reasoned it all out, night after night
after night, fought it out, <i>torn</i> it out, that he probably
really and truly did love me quite a good deal&mdash;in
his own way&mdash;when there wasn't anything
else to do. But how can it possibly content a woman
to have a man love her as well as <i>he</i> knows how&mdash;if
it isn't as well as <i>she</i> knows how? We won't
talk about&mdash;Aleck Reese's morals," she finished
abruptly. "Fickleness, selfishness, neglect, even infidelity
itself, are such purely minor, incidental data
of the one big, incurably rotten and distasteful fact
that&mdash;such and such a man is <i>stupid in the affections</i>."</p>

<p>With growing weakness she sank back in her
chair and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>For an anxious moment Drew sat and watched
her. "Is that all?" he asked at last.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>She opened her eyes in surprise. "Why, yes,"
she said, "that's all&mdash;that is, it's all if you understand.
I'm not complaining because Aleck Reese
didn't love me, but because, loving me, he wasn't
<i>intelligent</i> enough to be true to me. You do understand,
don't you? You understand that it
wasn't because he didn't pay his love bills, but because
he didn't know enough to pay them. He
took my loyalty without paying for it with his; he
took my devotion, my tenderness, my patience, without
ever, ever making any adequate return. Any
girl ought to be able to tell in six months whether
her lover is using her affection rightly, whether he
is taking her affection and investing it with his
toward their mutual happiness and home. Aleck
invested nothing. He just took all my love that
he could grab and squandered it on himself&mdash;always
and forever on himself. A girl, I say, ought
to be able to tell in six months. But I am very
stupid. It has taken me three years."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want <i>me</i> to do?" Drew
asked a bit quizzically.</p>

<p>"I want you to advise me," she said.</p>

<p>"Advise you&mdash;<i>what?</i>" persisted Drew.</p>

<p>The first real flicker of comedy flamed in the
girl's face. Her white cheeks pinked and dimpled.
"Why, advise me to&mdash;marry <i>you!</i>" she announced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
"<span class="smcap">well, why not?</span>" She fairly hurled
the three-word bridge across the sudden, awful
chasm of silence that yawned before her.</p>

<p>Drew's addled mind caught the phrase dully and
turned it over and over without attempting to
cross on it. "Well, why not? Well, why not?"
he kept repeating. His discomfiture filled the girl
with hysterical delight, and she came and perched
herself opposite him on the farther end of his desk
and smiled at him.</p>

<p>"It seems to me perfectly simple," she argued.
"Without any doubt or question you certainly are
the kind of man whom I should like to marry.
You are true and loyal and generous and rugged
about things. And you like the things that I like.
And I like the people that you like. And, most of
anything in the world, you are <i>clever in the affections</i>.
You are heart-wise as well as head-wise.
Why, even in the very littlest, silliest thing that
could possibly matter, you wouldn't&mdash;for instance&mdash;remember
George Washington's birthday and
forget mine. And you wouldn't go away on a
lark and leave me if I was sick, any more than
you'd blow out the gas. And you wouldn't&mdash;hurt
me about&mdash;other women&mdash;any more than
you'd eat with your knife." Impulsively she
reached over and patted his hand with the tips of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
her fingers. "As far as I can see," she teased,
"there's absolutely no fault in you that matters
to me except that I don't happen to love you."</p>

<p>Quick as her laugh the tears came scalding back
to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, Drew," she hurried on desperately,
"people seem to think it's a dreadful thing to
marry a man whom you don't love; but nobody
questions your marrying <i>any</i> kind of a man if you
do love him. As far as I can make out, then,
it's the love that matters, not the man. Then why
not love the right man?" She began to smile
again. "So here and now, sir, I deliberately choose
to love <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>But Drew's fingers did not even tighten over
hers.</p>

<p>"I want to be a happy woman," she pleaded.
"Why, I'm only twenty-two. I can't let my life
be ruined now. There's <i>got</i> to be some way out.
And I'm going to find that way out if I have to
crawl on my hands and knees for a hundred years.
I'm luckier than some girls. I've got such a shining
light to aim for."</p>

<p>Almost roughly Drew pulled his hand away, the
color surging angrily into his cheeks. "I'm no
shining light," he protested hotly, "and you shall
never, never come crawling on your hands and
knees to me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I shall," whispered the girl. "I shall
come creeping very humbly, if you want me. And
you do want me, don't you? Oh, please advise
me. Oh, please play you are my Father or my Big
Brother and advise me to&mdash;marry <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Drew laughed in spite of himself. "Play I was
your Father or your Big Brother?" Mimicry was
his one talent. "Play I was your Father or your
Big Brother and advise you to marry me?"</p>

<p>Instantly his fine, straight brows came beetling
down across his eyes in a fierce paternal scrutiny.
Then, quick as a wink, he had rumpled his hair
and stuck out his chest in a really startling imitation
of Big Brother's precious, pompous importance.
But before Ruth could clap her hands his
face flashed back again into its usual keen, sad
gravity, and he shook his head. "Yes," he deliberated,
"perhaps if I truly were your Father or
your Brother, I really should advise you to marry&mdash;me&mdash;not
because I amount to anything and am
worth it, but because I honestly believe that I should
be good to you&mdash;and I know that Aleck Reese
wouldn't be. But if I'm to advise you in my own
personal capacity&mdash;no, Ruthy, I don't want to
marry you!"</p>

<p>"What? What?" Staggering from the desk,
she turned and faced him, white as her dress,
blanched to her quivering lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>But Drew's big shoulders blocked her frenzied
effort to escape.</p>

<p>"Don't go away like that, Little Girl," he said.
"You don't understand. It isn't a question of
caring. You know I care. But don't you, don't
you understand that a man doesn't like to marry a
woman who doesn't love him?"</p>

<p>Her face brightened piteously. "But I <i>will</i> love
you?" she protested. "I <i>will</i> love you. I promise.
I promise you faithfully&mdash;I will love you&mdash;if
you'll only give me just a little time." The old
flicker of mischief came back to her eyes, and she
began to count on her fingers. "Let me see," she
said. "It's June now&mdash;June, July, August, September,
October, November&mdash;six months. I
promise you that I will love you by November."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it." Drew fairly slashed the
words into the air.</p>

<p>Instantly the hurt, frightened look came back to
her eyes. "Why, Drew," she whispered, "if it
were money that I wanted, if I were starving, or
sick, or any all-alone anything, you wouldn't refuse
to help me just because you couldn't possibly
see ahead just how I was ever going to pay you.
Drew, I'm very unhappy and frightened and lost-feeling.
I just want to borrow your love. I promise
you I will pay it back to you. You won't be
sorry. You won't. You won't!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Drew's hand reached up and smothered the words
on her lips. "You can't borrow my love," he
said sternly. "It's yours, always, every bit of it.
But I won't marry you unless you love me. I tell
you it isn't fair to you."</p>

<p>Impulsively she took his hand and led him back
to the big chair and pushed him gently into it, and
perched herself like a little child on a pile of bulky
law books at his feet. The eyes that looked up to
his were very hopeful.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Drew," she argued, "that
just being willing to marry you is love enough?"</p>

<p>He scanned her face anxiously for some inner,
hidden meaning to her words, some precious, latent
confession; but her eyes were only blue, and just a
little bit shy.</p>

<p>She stooped forward suddenly, and took Drew's
hand and brushed it across her cheek to the edge
of her lips. "I feel so safe with you, Drew," she
whispered, "so safe, and comforted always. Oh,
I'm sure I can teach you how to make me love
you&mdash;and you're the only man in the world that
I'm willing to teach." Her chin stiffened suddenly
with renewed stubbornness. "<i>You</i> are the Harbor
that was meant for me, and Aleck Reese is nothing
but a&mdash;Storm. If you know it, and I know it,
what's the use of dallying?"</p>

<p>Drew's solemn eyes brightened. "Do you truly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
think," he said, "that Aleck Reese is only an accident
that happened to you on your way to me?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head. Weakness and tears were
only too evidently overtaking her brave little theories.</p>

<p>"And there's something else, too," she confided
tremulously. "My head isn't right. I have
such hideous dreams when I do get to sleep. I
dream of drowning myself, and it feels good; and
I dream of jumping off high buildings, and it feels
good; and I dream of throwing myself under railroad
trains, and it feels good. And I see the
garish announcement in the morning papers, and
I picture how Uncle Terry would look when he
got the news, and I cry and cry and cry, and it feels
good. Oh, Drew, I'm so bored with life! It isn't
right to be so bored with life. But I can't seem
to help it. Nothing in all the world has any meaning
any more. Flowers, sunshine, moonlight&mdash;everything
I loved has gone stale. There's no
taste left to anything; there's no fragrance, there's
no rhyme. Drew, I could stand the sorrow part
of it, but I simply can't stand the emptiness. I
tell you I <i>can't</i> stand it. I wish I were dead; and,
Drew, there are so many, many easy ways all the
time to make oneself dead. I'm not safe. Oh,
please take me and make me safe. Oh, please take
me and make me want to live!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Driven almost distracted by this final appeal
to all the chivalrous love in his nature, Drew
jumped up and paced the floor. Perplexity, combativeness,
and ultimate defeat flared already in his
haggard face.</p>

<p>The girl sensed instantly the advantage that she
had gained. "Of course," she persisted, "of
course I see now, all of a sudden, that I'm not
offering you very much in offering you a wife who
doesn't love you. You are quite right; of course
I shouldn't make you a very good wife at first&mdash;maybe
not for quite a long, long time. Probably
it would all be too hard and miserable for
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Drew interrupted her fiercely. "Great heavens!"
he cried out, "my part would be easy, comfortable,
serene, interesting, compared to yours.
Don't you know it's nothing except <i>sad</i> to be shut
up in the same house, in the same life, with a person
you love who doesn't love you? Nothing but
sad, I tell you; and there's no special nervous
strain about being sad. But to be shut up day
and night&mdash;as long as life lasts&mdash;with a person
who takes the impudent liberty of loving you
against your wish to be loved&mdash;oh, the spiritual
distastefulness of it, and the physical enmity, and
the ghastly, ghastly ennui! That's your part of
it. Flower or book or jewel or caress, no agonizing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
heart-breaking, utterly wholesome effort to
please, but just one hideously chronic, mawkishly
conscientious effort to <i>be</i> pleased, to act pleased&mdash;though
it blast your eyes and sear your lips&mdash;to
<i>look</i> pleased. I tell you I won't have it!"</p>

<p>"I understand all that," said Ruth gravely. "I
understand it quite perfectly. But underneath it
all&mdash;I would rather&mdash;you had taken me in your
arms&mdash;as though I were a little, little hurt girl&mdash;and
comforted me&mdash;"</p>

<p>But before Drew's choking throat-cry had
reached his lips she had sprung from her seat and
was facing him defiantly. Across her face flared
suddenly for the first time the full, dark flush of
one of Life's big tides, and the fear in her hands
reached up and clutched at Drew's shoulders. The
gesture tipped her head back like a fagged swimmer's
struggling in the water.</p>

<p>"I am pleading for my life, Drew," she gasped,
"for my body, for my soul, for my health, for
my happiness, for home, for safety!"</p>

<p>He snatched her suddenly into his arms. "My
God! Ruth," he cried, "what do you want me to
do?"</p>

<p>Triumph came like a holiday laugh to her haggard
face.</p>

<p>"What do I want you to do?" she dimpled.
"Why, I want you to come with me now and get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a license. I want to be married right away this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"What!" Drew hurled the word at her like
a bomb, but it did not seem to explode.</p>

<p>Laughingly, flushingly, almost delightedly, she
stood and watched the anger rekindle in his face.</p>

<p>"Do you think I am going to take advantage of
you like this?" he asked hotly. "You would
probably change your mind to-morrow and be very,
very sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>She tossed her head. It was a familiar little
gesture. "I fully and confidently expect to be
sorry to-morrow," she affirmed cheerfully.
"That's why I want to be married to-day, this
afternoon, this minute, if possible, before I have
had any chance to change my mind."</p>

<p>Then, with unexpected abruptness, she shook her
recklessness aside and walked back to him childishly,
pulling a long, loose wisp of hair across her
face. "See," she said. "Smell the smoke in my
hair. It's the smoke from my burned bridges. I
sat up nearly all night and burned everything I
owned, everything that could remind me of Aleck
Reese, all my dresses, all my books, all my keepsakes,
all my doll houses that ever grew up into
dreams. So if you decide to marry me I shall be
very expensive. You'll have to take me just as
I am&mdash;quite a little bit crumpled, not an extra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
collar, not an extra hairpin, not anything. Aleck
Reese either loved or hated everything I owned.
I haven't left a single bridge on which one of
my thoughts could even crawl back to him again&mdash;"</p>

<p>Half quizzically, half caressingly, Drew stooped
down and brushed his lips across the lock of hair.
Fragrant as violets, soft as the ghost of a kiss, the
little curl wafted its dearness into his senses. But
ranker than violets, harsher than kisses, lurked the
blunt, unmistakable odor of ashes.</p>

<p>He laughed. And the laugh was bitter as gall.
"Burning your bridges," he mused. "It's a good
theory. But if I take your life into my bungling
hands and sweat my heart out trying to make you
love me, and come home every night to find you
crying with fear and heartbreak, will you still protest
that the sting in your eyes is nothing in the
world except the <i>smudge</i> from those burnt bridges?
Will you promise?"</p>

<p>With desperate literalness she clutched at the
phrase. Everything else in the room began to whirl
round and round like prickly stars. "I promise, I
promise," she gasped. Then sight&mdash;not air, but
just sight&mdash;seemed to be smothered right out of
her, and her brain reeled, and she wilted down unconscious
on the floor.</p>

<p>Cursing himself for a brute, Drew snatched her
up in a little, white, crumpled heap and started for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the window. Halfway there, the office door opened
abruptly and Ruth's Big Brother stood on the
threshold. Surprise, anxiety, ultimate relief chased
flashingly across the newcomer's face, and in an instant
both men were working together over the limp
little body.</p>

<p>"Well, old man," said the Big Brother, "I'm
glad she was here safe with you when she fainted."
His spare arm clapped down affectionately across
Drew's shoulders and jarred Drew's fingers brownly
against the death-like pallor of the girl's throat.
The Big Brother gave an ugly gasp. "Damn
Aleck Reese," he said.</p>

<p>Drew's eyes shut perfectly tight as though he
was smitten by some unbearable agony. Then suddenly,
without an instant's warning, he pulled himself
together and burst out laughing uproariously
like a schoolboy.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use of damning Aleck Reese?"
he cried. "Aleck Reese is as stale an issue as yesterday
morning's paper. If you've no particular
objection to me as a brother-in-law as well as a
tennis chum, Ruth and I were planning to marry
each other this afternoon. Maybe I was just a little
bit too vehement about it."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Three hours later, in a dusty, musty, mid-week
church vestry, an extraordinarily white and extraordinarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
vivacious girl was quite busy assuring a
credulous minister and a credulous sexton and a
credulous Big Brother that she would love till death
hushed her the perfectly incredulous bridegroom
who stood staring down upon her like a very tall
man in a very short dream.</p>

<p>And then, because neither groom nor bride could
think of anything specially married to say to each
other, they kidnapped Big Brother and bore him
away in an automobile to a nervous, rollicking, wonderfully
entertaining "shore dinner," where they
sat at an open window round a green-tiled table in
a marvelously glowering, ice-cool, artificial grotto,
and ate bright scarlet lobsters while the great, hot,
blowzy yellow moon came wallowing up out of the
night-shadowed sea, and the thrilly, thumpy brass
band played "I Love You So"; and the only, only
light in the whole vague, noisy room seemed to be
Big Brother's beaming, ecstatic face gleaming like
some glad phosphorescent thing through the clouds
of murky tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>Not till the wines and dines and roses and posies
and chatter and clatter were all over, and the automobile
had carried Big Brother off to his railroad
station and whisked the bride and groom back to
the wobbly city pavements, did Drew begin to realize
that the frolicking, jesting, crisp-tongued figure
beside him had wilted down into a piteous little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
hunch of fear. Stooping to push her slippery new
suit case closer under her feet, he caught the sharp,
shuddering tremor of her knees, and as the automobile
swayed finally into the street that led to his
apartment, her lungs seemed to crumple up in a
paroxysm of coughing. Under the garish lights
that marked his apartment-house doorway her slight
figure drooped like a tired flower, and the footsteps
that tinkled behind him along the stone corridor
rang in his ears with a dear, shy, girlish reluctance.
The elevator had stopped running. One flight, two
flights, three, four, five they toiled up the harsh,
cool, metallic stairway. Four times Ruth stopped
to get her breath, and twice to tie her shoe. Drew
laughed to himself at the delicious subterfuge of it.</p>

<p>Then at the very top of the strange, gloomy, midnight
building, when Drew's nervous fingers fumbled
a second with his door-lock, without the slightest
possible warning she reached out suddenly with
one mad, frenzied impulse and struck the key from
his hand. To his startled eyes she turned a face
more wild, more agonized than any terror he had
ever dreamed in his most hideous, sweating nightmare.
Instantly her hands went clutching out to
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Drew, for God's sake take me home!" she
gasped. "What have I done? What have I done?
What have I done? Oh, <span class="smcap">Aleck</span>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Wrenching himself free from her hands, Drew
dropped down on the floor and began to hunt around
for the key. The blood surged into his head like a
hot tide, and he felt all gritty-lunged and smothered,
as though he were crawling under water. After a
minute he stumbled to his feet and slipped the recreant
key smoothly into the lock, and swung his door
wide open, and turned back to Ruth. She stood
facing him defiantly, her eyes blazing, her poor
hands twisting.</p>

<p>Drew nodded toward the door, and shoved the
suit case with his foot across the threshold. His
face was very stern and set.</p>

<p>"You want me to take you 'home'?" he said.
"<i>This</i> is home. What do you mean? Take you
back to your Brother's house? You can't go back to
your Brother's house on your wedding day. It
wouldn't be fair to me. And I won't help you do
an unfair thing <i>even</i> to me. You've <i>got</i> to give
me a chance!"</p>

<p>He nodded again toward the open door, but the
girl did not budge. His face brightened suddenly,
and he stepped back to where she was standing, and
lifted her up in his arms and swung her to his shoulder
and stumbled through the pitch-black doorway.
"Do you remember," he cried, "the day at your
grammar-school picnic when I carried you over the
railroad trestle because the locomotive that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
swooping down upon us round the curve had scared
all the starch out of your legs? Look out for your
head now, honey, and I'll give you a very good imitation
of a cave man bringing home his bride."</p>

<p>In another moment he had switched a blaze of
electric light into his diminutive library, and deposited
his sobbing burden none too formally in the
big easy chair that blocked almost all the open space
between his desk and his bookcases. "What!
Aren't you laughing, too?" he cried in mock alarm.
But the crumpled little figure in the big chair did not
answer to his raillery.</p>

<p>Until it seemed as though he would totter from
his wavering foothold, Drew stood and watched her
dumbly. Then a voice that sounded strange even to
himself spoke out of his lips.</p>

<p>"Ruth&mdash;come here," he said.</p>

<p>She raised her rumpled head in astonishment,
gaged for a throbbing instant the new authoritative
glint in his eyes, and then slipped cautiously out of
her chair and came to him, reeking with despair.
For a second they just stood and stared at each
other, white face to white face, a map of anger confronting
a map of fear.</p>

<p>"You understand," said Drew, "that to-day, by
every moral, legal, religious right and rite, you have
delivered your life over utterly into my hands?"
His voice was like ice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," she answered feebly, with
the fresh tears gushing suddenly into her eyes.</p>

<p>Drew's mouth relaxed. "You understand?" he
repeated. "Well&mdash;forget it! And never, never,
never, as long as you and I are together, never, I
say, understand anything but this: you can cry about
Aleck Reese all you want to, but you sha'n't cry
about me. You can count on that anyway."
He started to smile, but his mouth twitched instead
with a wince of pain. "And I thought I could
really bring you heart's-ease," he scoffed. "Heart's-ease?
Bah!"</p>

<p>"Heart's-ease. Bah!" The familiar phrase exploded
Ruth's inflammable nerves into hysterical
laughter. "Why, that's what the lamb said," she
cried, "when I fed him on my pansy posies.
'Heart's-ease. B-a-h!'" And her sudden burst of
even unnatural delight cleared her face for the moment
of all its haggard tragedy, and left her once
more just a very fragile, very plaintive, very helpless,
tear-stained child. "You <i>b-a-a</i> exactly like
the lamb," she suggested with timid, snuffling pleasantry;
and at the very first suspicion of a reluctant
twinkle at the corner of Drew's eyes she reached up
her trembling little hands to his shoulders and held
him like a vise with a touch so light, so faint, so
timorous that it could hardly have detained the
shadow of a humming-bird.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment she stared exploringly round the
unfamiliar, bright little room crowded so horribly,
cruelly close with herself, her mistake, and the life-long
friend loomed so suddenly and undesirably
into a man. Then with a quick, shuddery blink her
eyes came flashing back wetly and wistfully to the
unsolved, inscrutable face before her. Her fingers
dug themselves frantically into his cheviot shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, Drew, Drew," she blurted out, "I am
so very&mdash;very&mdash;very&mdash;frightened! Won't you
please take me and play you are my&mdash;Mother?"</p>

<p>"Play I am your Mother? <i>Play I am your
Mother!</i>" The phrase ripped out of Drew's lips
like an oath, and twitched itself just in time into
explosive, husky mirth. "Play I am your
Mother?" The teeniest grimace over his left shoulder
outlined the soft silken swish and tug of a lady's
train. A most casual tap at his belt seemed to
achieve instantly the fashionable hour-glass outline
of feminine curves. "Play I am your Mother!"
He smiled and, stooping down, took Ruth's scared
white face between his hands, and his smile was as
bright&mdash;and just about as pleasant&mdash;as a zigzag
of lightning from a storm-black sky.</p>

<p>"Ruthy dear," he said, "I don't feel very much
like your Mother. Now if it was a cannibal that
you wanted, or a pirate, or a kidnapper, or a body-snatcher,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
or a general all-round robber of widows
and orphans, why, here I am, all dressed and trained
and labeled for the part. But a <i>Mother</i>&mdash;" The
smile went zigzagging again across his face just as a
big, wet, scalding tear came trickling down the girl's
cheek into his fingers. The feeling of that tear
made his heart cramp unpleasantly. "Oh, hang it
all," he finished abruptly, "what does a Mother do,
anyway?"</p>

<p>The little white face in his hands flooded instantly
with a great desolation. "I don't know," she
moaned wearily. "I <i>never</i> knew."</p>

<p>For some inexplainable reason Aleck Reese's devilish,
insolent beauty flaunted itself suddenly before
Drew's vision, and he gave a bitter gasp, and turned
away fiercely, and brushed his arm potently across
his forehead as though Sex, after all, were nothing
but a trivial mask that fastened loosely to the ears.</p>

<p>When he turned round again, his conquered face
had that strange, soft, shining, translucent wonder-look
in it which no woman all her life long may reap
twice from a man's face. Tenderly, serenely, uncaressingly,
without passion and without playfulness,
he picked up his sad little bride and carried her
back to the big, roomy, restful chair, and snuggled
her down in his long arms, with her smoke-scented
hair across his cheek, and told her funny, giggly
little stories, and crooned her funny, sleepy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
little songs, till her shuddering sobs soothed themselves&mdash;oh,
so slowly&mdash;into lazy, languid, bashful
little smiles, and the lazy, languid, bashful
little smiles droned off at last into nestling, contented
little sighs, and the nestling, contented little
sighs blossomed all of a sudden into merciful, peaceful
slumber.</p>

<p>Then, when the warm, gray June dawn was just
beginning to flush across the roofs of the city, he
put her softly down and slipped away, and took his
smallest military brushes, and his smallest dressing-gown,
and his smallest slippers, and carried them
out to his diminutive guest-room. "It isn't a very
big little guest-room," he mused disconsolately, "but
then, she isn't a very big little guest. It will hold
her, I guess, as long as she's willing to stay."</p>

<p>"As long as she's willing to stay." The phrase
puckered his lips. Again Aleck Reese's face flashed
before him in all its amazing beauty and magical
pathos, a face this time staring across a tiny, ornate
caf&eacute; table into the jaded, world-wise eyes of some
gorgeous woman of the theatrical demi-monde. At
the vision Drew's shoulders squared suddenly as
though for a fair fight to the finish, and then wilted
down with equal abruptness as his eyes met accidentally
in the mirror his own plain, matter-of-fact
reflection. The sight fairly mocked him. There
was no beauty there. No magic. No brilliance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
No talent. No compelling moodiness. No possible
promise of "Love and Fame and Far Lands."
Nothing. Just eyes and nose and mouth and hair
and an ugly baseball scar on his left cheek. Merciful
heavens! What had he to fight Aleck Reese
with, except the only two virtues that a man may
not brag of&mdash;a decently clean life and an unstaled
love!</p>

<p>Grinning to rekindle his courage, he started tiptoeing
back along the hall to his bedroom and his
kitchen, and rolled up his sleeves and began to clean
house most furiously; for even if you are quite desperately
in love, and a fairly good man besides, it is
just a little bit crowded-feeling and disconcerting to
have the lady walk unannounced right into your life
and your neckties and your pictures, to say nothing
of your last week's unwashed cream-jars.</p>

<p>Frantically struggling with his coffee-pot at seven
o'clock, he had almost forgotten his minor troubles
when a little short, gaspy breath sound made him
look up. Huddling her tired-out dress into the ample
folds of his dressing-gown, Ruth stood watching
him bashfully.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he said. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;Andrew Bernard, attorney at
law," she announced with stuttering nonchalance,
and started off exploringly for the cupboard to find
Drew's best green Canton china to deck the kitchen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
breakfast table. All through the tortuous little meal
she sat in absolute tongue-tied gravity, carving her
omelet into a hundred infinitesimal pieces and sipping
like a professional coffee-taster at Drew's over-rank
concoction. Only once did her solemn face
lighten with an inspirational flash that made Drew's
heart jump. Then, "Oh, Drew," she exclaimed,
"do you think you could go out to the house to-day
and see if they fed the lamb?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Drew bluntly, and poured
himself out his fifth cup of coffee.</p>

<p>After breakfast, all the time that he was shaving,
she came and sat on the edge of a table and
watched him with the same maddening gravity, and
when he finally started off for his office she followed
him down the whole length of his little hallway.
"I like my cave!" she volunteered with sudden sociability,
and then with a great, pink-flushing wave
of consciousness she lifted up her face to him and
stammered, "Do I kiss you good-by?"</p>

<p>Drew shook his head and laughed. "No," he
said, "you don't even have to do that; I'm not
much of a kisser," and turned abruptly and grabbed
at the handle of the door.</p>

<p>But before he had crossed the threshold she
reached out and pulled him back for a moment, and
he had to stoop down very far to hear what she
wanted to tell him. "It's nothing much, Drew,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
she whispered. "It's nothing much at all. I just
wanted to say that&mdash;considering how strong they
are, and how&mdash;wild&mdash;and strange&mdash;I think men
are&mdash;very&mdash;<i>gentle</i> creatures. Thank you." And
in another instant she had gone back alone to face
by crass daylight the tragedy that she had brought
into three people's lives.</p>

<p>Certainly in all the days and weeks that followed,
Drew never failed to qualify as a "gentle creature."
Not a day passed at his office that he did not telephone
home with the most casual-sounding pleasantry,
"Is everything all right? Any burnt-bridge
smoke in the air?" Usually, clear as his own voice,
and sometimes even with a little giggle tucked on
at the end, the answer came, "Yes, everything's
all right." But now and then over that telephone
wire a minor note flashed with unmistakably tremulous
vibration: "N-o, Drew. Oh, could you
come right home&mdash;and take me somewhere?"</p>

<p>Drew's brown cheeks hollowed a bit, perhaps, as
time went on, but always smilingly, always frankly
and jocosely, he met the occasionally recurrent
emergencies of his love-life. Underneath his smile
and underneath his frankness his original purpose
never flinched and never wavered. With growing
mental intimacy and absolute emotional aloofness
he forced day by day the image and the consciousness
of his personality upon the girl's plastic mind:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
his picture, for instance, as a matter of course for
her locket; his favorite, rather odd, colors for her
clothes; his sturdy, adventuresome, fleet-footed
opinions to run ahead and break in all her strange
new thought-grounds for her. More than this, in
every possible way that showed to the world he
stamped her definitely as the most carefully cherished
wife among all her young married mates.</p>

<p>At first the very novelty of the situation had fed
his eyes with rapture and fired the girl's face with
a feverish excitement almost as pink as happiness.
The surprise and congratulations of their friends,
the speech of the janitor, the floral offering of the
elevator boy, the long procession of silver spoons
and cut-glass dishes, had filled their days with interest
and laughter. Trig in her light muslin house
gowns or her big gingham aprons, Ruth fluttered
blissfully around her house like a new, brainy sort
of butterfly. By some fine, instinctive delicacy,
shrewder than many women's love, she divined and
forestalled Drew's domestic tastes and preferences,
and lined his simplest, homespun needs with all the
quiver and sheen of silk. Resting his weariness,
spurring his laziness; equally quick to divine the
need of a sofa pillow or a joke; equally interested
in his food and his politics; always ready to talk,
always ready to keep still; cramping her free suburban
ways into his hampered accommodations;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
missing her garden and her pets and her piazzas
without ever acknowledging it&mdash;she tried in every
plausible way except loving to compensate Drew for
the wrong she had done him.</p>

<p>Only once did Drew's smoldering self-control slip
the short leash he had set for himself. Just once,
round the glowing coziness of a rainy-night open
fire, he had dropped his book slammingly on the
floor and reached out his hand to her soft hair that
brightened like bronze in the lamplight. "Are you
happy?" he had probed before he could fairly bite
the words back; and she had jumped up, and tossed
her hair out of her eyes, and laughed as she started
for the kitchen. "No, I'm not exactly happy,"
she had said. "But I'm awfully&mdash;interested."</p>

<p>So June budded into July, and July bloomed into
August, and August wilted into September, and
September brittled and crisped and flamed at last
into October. Tennis and boating and picnics and
horseback riding filled up the edges of the days.
Little by little the bright, wholesome red came back
to live in Ruth's rounding cheeks. Little by little
the good steady gleam of normal interests supplanted
the wild will-o'-the-wisp lights in her eyes.
Little by little her accumulating possessions began
to steel shyly out from her tiny room and make
themselves boldly at home in the places where hitherto
they had ventured only as guests. Her workbasket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
crowded Drew's tobacco-jar deliberately
from the table to the top of the bookcase. Her
daring hands nonchalantly replaced a brutally clever
cartoon with a soft-toned sketch of a little child.
Once, indeed, an ostentatiously freshly laundered
dress, all lace and posies and ruffles, went and hung
itself brazenly in Drew's roomy closet right next
to his fishing clothes.</p>

<p>And then, just as Drew thought that at last he
saw Happiness stop and turn and look at him a bit
whimsically, Aleck Reese came back to town&mdash;Aleck
Reese, not as Fate should have had him,
drunken with flattery, riotous with revelry, chasing
madly some new infatuation, but Aleck Reese
sobered, dazed, temporarily purified by the shock of
his loss, if not by the loss itself.</p>

<p>For a week, blissfully unconscious of any cause,
Drew had watched with growing perplexity and
anxiety the sudden, abrupt flag in the girl's health
and spirits and general friendliness. Flowers,
fruit, candy, books, excursion plans had all successively,
one by one, failed to rouse either her interest
or her ordinary civility. And then one night, dragging
home extra late from a worried, wearisome
day at the office, faint for his dinner, sick for his
sleep, he found the apartment perfectly dark and
cheerless, the fire unlighted, the table unset, and
Ruth herself lying in a paroxysm of grief on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
floor under his stumbling feet. With his dizzy
head reeling blindly, and his hands shaking like an
aspen, he picked her up and tried to carry her to
the couch; but she wrenched herself away from him,
and walked over to the window and halfway back
again before she spoke.</p>

<p>"Aleck Reese has come home," she announced
dully, and reached up unthinkingly and turned a
blast of electric light full on her ghastly face.</p>

<p>Drew clutched at the back of the nearest chair.
"Have you seen him?" he almost whispered.</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Yes. He's been here a
week. I've seen him twice. Once&mdash;all day at the
tennis club&mdash;and this afternoon I met him on the
street, and he came home with me to get&mdash;a book."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me before that he was
here?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders wearily. "I thought
his coming wasn't going to matter," she faltered,
"but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" said Drew.</p>

<p>Her arms fell limply down to her sides and her
chin began to quiver.</p>

<p>"He kissed me this afternoon," she stammered,
"and I&mdash;kissed him. And, worse than that, we
were both&mdash;glad."</p>

<p>Trying to brush the fog away from his eyes,
Drew almost sprang across the room at her, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
gave a queer little cry and fled, not away from him,
but right into his arms, as though <i>there</i> was her only
haven. "Would you be apt to hurt me?" she
gasped with a funny-sad sort of inquisitiveness.
Then she backed away and held out her hand like a
man's to Drew's shaking fingers. "I'm very much
ashamed," she said, "about this afternoon. Oh,
very, very, very much ashamed. I haven't ever
been a really good wife to you, you know, but I
never have cheated before until to-day. I promise
you faithfully that it sha'n't happen again. But,
Drew"&mdash;her face flushed utterly crimson&mdash;"but,
Drew&mdash;I honestly think that it <i>had</i> to happen to-day."</p>

<p>Drew's tortured eyes watched her keenly for a
second and then his look softened. "Will you
please tell Aleck," he suggested, "that you told me
all about it and that I&mdash;laughed?"</p>

<p>It was not till some time in December, however,
after a nervous, evasive, speechless sort of week,
that Ruth appeared abruptly one day at Drew's office,
looking for all the world like the frightened
child who had sought him out there the June before.</p>

<p>"Drew, you're five years older than I am, aren't
you?" she began disconnectedly. "And you've
always been older than I am, and stronger than I
am, and wiser than I am. And you've always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
gone ahead in school and play and everything, and
learned what you wanted to and then come back&mdash;and
gotten me. And it always made everything&mdash;oh,
so much easier for me&mdash;and I thought it was a
magic scheme that simply couldn't fail to work.
But I'm afraid I'm not quite as smart as I used to
be&mdash;I can't seem to catch up with you this time."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Drew.</p>

<p>She began to fidget with her gloves. "Do you
know what month it is?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Drew, just a bit drearily.
"It's December. What of it?"</p>

<p>Her eyes blurred, but she kept them fixed steadily
on her husband. "Why, don't you remember," she
gasped, "that when we were married I promised
you faithfully that I would love you within six
months? The six months were up in November&mdash;but
I find I'm not quite ready&mdash;yet. You'll have
to give me a little more time," she pleaded.
"You'll have to renew my love-loan. Will you?"</p>

<p>Drew slammed down his law books and forced
his mouth into a grin. "I'd forgotten all about
that arrangement," he said. "Of course I'll renew
what you call your 'love-loan.' Really and truly I
didn't expect you to love me before a full year was
up. Heart-wounds don't ever even begin to heal
until their first anniversaries are passed&mdash;all the
Christmases and birthdays and Easters. And,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
really, I'd quite as soon anyway that you didn't love
me till Spring," he added casually. "I'm so hideously
busy and worried just now with business
things."</p>

<p>She gave him an odd little look that barely grazed
his face and settled flutteringly on the book in his
hand. It was a ponderous-looking treatise on "The
Annulment of Marriage." Her heart began to
pound furiously. "Drew!" she blurted out, "I
simply can't stand things any longer. I shall go
mad. I've tried and tried and tried to be good, and
it's no use. I must be stupid. I must be a fool.
<span class="smcap">But I want to go home!</span>"</p>

<p>"All right," said Drew very quietly, "you&mdash;can&mdash;go&mdash;home."</p>

<p>In another instant, without good-by or regret, she
had flashed out of the office and was racing down
the stairs. Halfway to the street she missed her
handkerchief, and started reluctantly back to get it.
The office door was locked, but she tiptoed round
to a private side entrance and opened the door very
cautiously and peeped in.</p>

<p>Prostrate across his great, cluttered desk, Drew,
the serene, the laughing, the self-sufficient, lay sobbing
like a woman.</p>

<p>Startled as though she had seen a ghost, the girl
backed undetected out of the door, and closed it
very softly behind her, nor did she stop tiptoeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
until she had reached the street floor. Then, dropping
down weak-kneed upon the last step, she sat
staring out into the dingy patch of snow that flared
now and then through the swinging doorway.
Somewhere out in that vista Aleck Reese was waiting
and watching for her. Two or three of her husband's
business acquaintances paused and accosted
her. "Anything the matter?" they probed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she answered brightly. "I'm just
thinking."</p>

<p>After a while she jumped up abruptly and stole
back through a box-cluttered hall to the rear door
of the building, and slid out unnoticed into a side
street, gathering her great fur coat&mdash;Drew's latest
gift&mdash;closer and closer around her shivering body.
The day was gray and bleak and scarily incomplete,
like the work of some amateur creator who had
slipped up on the one essential secret of how to
make the sun shine. The jingliest sound of sleigh-bells,
the reddest flare of holiday shop windows,
could not cheer her thoughts away from the stinging,
shuddering memory of Drew's crumpled shoulders,
the gasping catch of his breath, the strange
new flicker of gray at his temples. Over and over
to herself she kept repeating dully: "I've hurt
Drew just the way that Aleck hurt me. It mustn't
be. It mustn't be&mdash;it mustn't! There's got to
be some way out!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Then most unexpectedly, at the first street corner
she was gathered up joyously by a crowd of her
young married chums who were starting off in an
automobile for their sewing-club in Ruth's own old-home
suburb fifteen miles away. It was a long
time since she had played very freely with women,
and the old associations caught her interest with a
novel charm. Showered with candy, gay with
questions, happy with laughter, the party whizzed
up at last to the end of its journey, and tumbled
out rosy with frost and mischief to join the women
who had already arrived. From every individual
corner of the warm, lazy sewing-room some one
seemed to jump up and greet Ruth's return. "Oh,
you pampered young bride!" they teased, and "Will
you look at the wonderful fur coat and hat that
have happened to Ruth!" Even the sad-faced, widowed
little dressmaker who always officiated professionally
at the club wriggled out of her seat and
brought her small boy 'way across the room to stroke
the girl's sumptuous mink-brown softness.</p>

<p>"Why, am I so very wonderful?" stammered
Ruth, staring down with her hands in her pockets at
the great fur length and breadth of her.</p>

<p>"Well, if I had a coat like that," scoffed a shrill
voice from the sofa, "I should think that it was the
most wonderful thing in life that could happen to
me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Standing there scorching herself in the fire-glow,
Ruth looked up suddenly with a fierce sort of intentness.
"You wise old married people," she
cried, "tell me truly what really is the most wonderful
thing in life that can happen to a woman?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, is it a new riddle?" shouted her hostess,
and instantly a dozen noisy answers came rollicking
into the contest. "Money!" cried the extravagant
one. "A husband who goes to the club
every night!" screamed the flirt. "Health!"
"Curls!" "Dresden china!" "Single blessedness!"
the suggestions came piling in. Only the dressmaker's
haggard face whitened comprehendingly to
the hunger underneath Ruth's laughing eyes. Staring
scornfully at the heaping luxuries all around
her, the shabby, widow-marked woman snatched up
her child and cuddled it to her breast. "The most
wonderful thing in life that can happen to a
woman?" she quoted passionately. "I'll tell you
what it is. It's being able to hope that your son
will be <i>exactly</i> like his father."</p>

<p>"Exactly like his father?" The shrewd sting
and lash of the words ripped through Ruth's senses
like the scorch of a red-hot fuse. Strength, tenderness,
patience, love, loyalty flamed up before her
with such dazzling brilliance that she could scarcely
fathom the features behind them, and the room
whirled dizzily with sudden excessive heat. "Exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
like his father." A dozen feminine voices
caught up the phrase and dropped it blisteringly.
The wife of the town's <i>bon vivant</i> winced a trifle.
The most radiant bride of the year jabbed her fingers
accidentally with her scissors. Some one
started to sigh and laughed instead. A satirical
voice suggested, "Well, but of course there's got
to be some improvement in every generation."</p>

<p>Smothering for air, Ruth reached up bunglingly
and fastened her big fur collar and started for the
door. "Oh, no," she protested to every one's detaining
hands, "honestly I didn't intend to stay.
I've got to hurry over to the house and get some
things before dark," and, pleading several equally
legitimate excuses, she bolted out into the snowy
fields to take the quickest possible short cut to her
Big Brother's house.</p>

<p>Every plowing step drove her heart pounding
like an engine, and every lagging footfall started
her scared thoughts throbbing louder than her heart.
Hurry as fast as she could, stumbling over drift-hidden
rocks or floundering headlong into some hollow,
she could not seem to outdistance the startling,
tumultuous memory of the little dressmaker's passion-glorified
eyes staring scornfully down on the
slowly sobering faces of the women around her.
The vision stung itself home to the girl like sleet
in her eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"O-h!" she groaned. "What a wicked thing
Life is&mdash;wasting a man like Drew on a girl&mdash;like
me. 'To be able to hope that your son will be
exactly like his father!'" Her heart jumped.
Merciful heavens! If Happiness were really&mdash;only
as simple a thing as that&mdash;just to look in your
husband's eyes and find them good. Years and
years hence, perhaps, she herself might have a son&mdash;with
all his father's blessed, winsome virtues.
Her eyes flooded suddenly with angry tears. "Oh,
could Fate possibly, possibly be so tricky as to make
a woman love her son because he <i>was</i> like his father,
and yet all, all the long years make that woman just
miss loving the father himself?"</p>

<p>With a little frightened gasp she began to run.
"If I only can get to the house," she reasoned,
"then everything will be all right. And I'll never
leave it again."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, panting and flushing, she
twisted her latch-key through the familiar home
door. No one was there to greet her. From attic
to cellar the whole house was deserted. At first
the emptiness and roominess seemed to ease and
rest her, but after a little while she began to get lonesome,
and started out to explore familiar corners,
and found them unfamiliar. "What an ugly new
wall-paper!" she fretted; "and what a silly way to
set the table!" Her old room smote upon her with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
strange surprise&mdash;not cunningly, like one's funny
little baby clothes, but distastefully, like a last year's
outgrown coat. In the large, light pantry a fresh
disappointment greeted her. "What an insipid
salad!" she mourned. "It isn't half as nice as
the salad Drew makes." Cookies, cakes, doughnuts
failed her successively. "And I used to think
they were the best I ever tasted," she puzzled. In
the newly upholstered parlor a queer unrest sickened
her. "Why, the house doesn't seem quite to&mdash;fit
me any more," she acknowledged, and bundled
herself into her coat again, and stuffed her
pockets with apples, and started off more gladly for
the barn.</p>

<p>As she pushed back the heavy sliding doors a
horse whinnied, possibly for welcome, but probably
for oats. Teased by the uncertainty, the girl threw
back her head and laughed. "Hello, all you animals,"
she cried; "I have come home. Isn't it
fine?"</p>

<p>Up from the floor of his pen the lamb rose clatteringly
like a mechanical toy, and met the glad
news with a peculiarly disdainful "B-a-a-a!"
Back to the sheltering wood-pile her old friends
the kittens&mdash;little cats now&mdash;fled from her with
precipitous fear. The white-nosed cow reared back
with staring eyes. The pet horse snapped at her
fingers instead of the apple. The collie dog, to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
sure, came jumping boisterously, but the jumpiness
was unmistakably because he was "Carlo," and not
because she was "Ruth." And yet only six months
before every animal on the place had looked like
her with that strange, absurd mimicry of human expression
that characterizes the faces of all much-cherished
birds or beasties. And now even the collie
dog had reverted to the plain, blank-featured
canine street type&mdash;and the pet horse looked like
the hired man.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/gs06.jpg" width="368" height="500" alt="&quot;Hello, all you animals,&quot; she cried" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Hello, all you animals,&quot; she cried</span>
</div>

<p>The girl's forehead puckered up into a bewildered
sort of frown. "I don't quite seem to belong anywhere,"
she concluded. The thought was unpleasant.
Worst of all, the increasing, utterly unexplainable
sob in her throat made her feel very reluctant
to go back into the house and wait for her Brother
and the Housekeeper and the inevitable questions.
Dallying there on the edge of the wheelbarrow,
munching her red-cheeked apples, it was almost eight
o'clock before her mind quickened to a solution of
her immediate difficulties. She would hide in the
hay all night, there in the sweetness and softness
of last summer's beautiful grass, and think out her
problems and decide what to do.</p>

<p>Deep in the hay she burrowed out a nest, and
lined it with the biggest buffalo robe and the thickest
carriage rug. Then one by one she carried up
the astonished kittens, and the heavy, fat lamb, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the scrambling collie dog to keep her company, and
snuggled herself down, warm and content, to drowse
and dream amidst the musty cobwebs, and the short,
sharp snap of straws, and the soothing sighs of the
sleepy cow, and the stamp, stamp of the horse, and
all the extra, indefinite, scary, lonesome night noises
that keep your nerves exploding intermittently like
torpedoes and start your common sense scouring
like a silver polish at all the tarnished values of your
everyday life.</p>

<p>Midnight found her lying wide awake and starry-eyed,
with her red lips twisted into an oddly inscrutable
smile. Close in her left hand the collie
dog nestled his grizzly nose. Under her right arm
the woolly lamb slumbered. Over her quiet feet the
little cats purred with fire-gleaming faces.</p>

<p>Attracted by the barking of his new bulldog, Big
Brother came out in the early morning and discovered
her in the hay.</p>

<p>"Well, for heaven's sake!" he began. "Where
did you come from? Where does Drew think you
are? He's been telephoning here all night trying
to find you. I guess he's scared to death. Great
Scott! what's the matter? What are you hiding
out here for? Have you had any trouble with
Drew?"</p>

<p>She slid down out of her nest with the jolliest
sort of a laugh. "Of course I haven't had any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
trouble with Drew. I just wanted to come home.
That's all. Drew buys me everything else," she
dimpled, "but he simply won't buy me any hay&mdash;and
I'm such a donkey."</p>

<p>Big Brother shrugged his shoulders. "You're
just as foolish as ever," he began, and then finished
abruptly with "What a perfectly absurd way to do
your hair! It looks like fury."</p>

<p>An angry flush rose to her cheeks, and she reached
up her hands defensively. "It suits Drew all
right," she retorted.</p>

<p>Big Brother laughed. "Well, come along in the
house and get your breakfast and telephone Drew."</p>

<p>The funniest sort of an impulse smote suddenly
upon Ruth's mind. "I don't want any breakfast,"
she protested, "and I don't want any telephone.
I'm going home this minute to surprise Drew.
We were going to have broiled chicken, and a new
dining-room table, and a pot of primroses as big as
your head. Shall I have time to wash my face before
the car comes?"</p>

<p>Ten minutes after that she was running like mad
to the main street. An hour later the big, whizzing
electric car that was speeding her back to the city
crashed headlong at a curve into another brittling,
splintering mass of screams and blood and broken
glass and shivering woodwork.</p>

<p>When she came to her senses she was lying in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
blood-stained furs on some one's piazza floor, and
the horrid news of the accident must have traveled
very quickly, for a great crowd of people was
trampling round over the snowy lawn, and Big
Brother and Aleck Reese and the old family doctor
seemed to have dropped down right out of the snow-whirling
sky. Just as she opened her eyes, Aleck
Reese, haggard with fear and dissipation, was
kneeling down trying to slip his arms under her.</p>

<p>With the mightiest possible effort she lifted her
forefinger warningly.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare touch me," she threatened. "I
promised Drew&mdash;"</p>

<p>The doctor looked up astonished into her wide-open
eyes. "Now, Ruth," he begged, "don't you
make any fuss. We've got to get you into a carriage.
We'll try not to hurt you any more than is
absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>Her shattered nerves failed her utterly. "What
nonsense!" she sobbed. "You don't have to hurt
me at all. My own man never hurts me at all. I
tell you I want my own man."</p>

<p>"But we can't find Drew," protested the doctor.</p>

<p>Then the blood came gushing back into her eyes
and some wicked brute took her bruised knees, and
her wrenched back, and her broken collar bone, and
her smashed head, and jarred them all up together
like a bag of junk, and she gave one awful, blood-curdling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
yell&mdash;and a horse whinnied&mdash;and everything
in the world stopped happening like a run-down
clock.</p>

<p>When Time began to tick normally again, she
found herself lying with an almost solid cotton face
in a pleasant, puffy bed that seemed to rock, and
roll, and tug against her straining arm that clutched
its fingers like an anchor into somebody's perfectly
firm, kind hand. As far away as a voice on a
shore, tired, hoarse, desperately incessant, some one
was signaling reassurance to her: "You're all
right, honey, You're all right, honey."</p>

<p>After a long time her fingers twittered in the
warm grasp. "Who are you?" she stammered
perplexedly.</p>

<p>"Just your 'own man,'" whispered Drew.</p>

<p>The lips struggling out from the edge of the
bandage quivered a little. "My 'own man'?" she
repeated with surprise. "Who was the tattletale
that told you?" She began to shiver suddenly
in mental or physical agony. "Oh, I remember it
all now," she gasped. "Was the little boy killed
who sat in the corner seat?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know," said Drew, and his voice
rasped unexpectedly with the sickening strain of
the past few hours.</p>

<p>At the sound she gave a panic-stricken sob. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
believe I'm dead myself, Drew," she cried, "and
you're trying to keep it from me. Where am I?
Tell me instantly where I am."</p>

<p>Drew's laugh rang out before he could control
it. "You're here in your own little room," he assured
her.</p>

<p>"Prove it," she whimpered hysterically. "Tell
me what's on my bureau."</p>

<p>He jumped up and walked across the room to
make sure. "Why, there's a silver-backed mirror,
and a box of violet powder, and a package of safety
pins."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" she said. "Those might be on any
angel's bureau. What else do you see?"</p>

<p>He fumbled a minute among the glass and silver
and gave a quick sigh of surprise. "Here's your
wedding ring."</p>

<p>"Bring it to me," she pleaded, and took the tiny
golden circlet blindly from his hand and slipped it
experimentally once or twice up and down her finger.
"Yes, that's it," she assented, and handed it
back to him. "Hurry&mdash;quick&mdash;before anybody
comes."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" faltered Drew.</p>

<p>She reached up wilfully and yanked the bandage
away from the corner of one eye.</p>

<p>"Why, put the ring back on my finger where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
it belongs!" she said. "We're going to begin all
over again. Play that I am your wife!" she demanded
tremulously.</p>

<p>Drew winced like raw flesh. "You are my
wife," he cried. "You are! You are! You
are!"</p>

<p>With all the strength that was left to her she
groped out and drew his face down to her lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've invented a lots better game than that,"
she whispered. "If we're going to play any game
at all&mdash;let's&mdash;play&mdash;that&mdash;I&mdash;love&mdash;you!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<h2>HEART OF THE CITY</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="162" height="164" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE dining-room was green, as
green could be. Under the orange-colored
candle-light, the
walls, rugs, ceiling, draperies,
ferns, glowed verdant, mysterious,
intense, like night woods arching
round a camp fire. Into this fervid, pastoral
verdure the round white table, sparkling with silver,
limpid with wine-lights, seemed to roll forth resplendent
and incongruous as a huge, tinseled snowball.</div>

<p>Outside, like fire engines running on velvet
wheels, the automobiles went humming along the
pavement. Inside, the soft, narrow, ribbony voice
of a violin came whimpering through the rose-scented
air.</p>

<p>It was the midst of dinner-party time. In the
oak-paneled hallway a shadowy, tall clock swallowed
gutturally on the verge of striking nine.</p>

<p>The moment was distinctly nervous. The <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
course was late, and the Hostess, gesticulating
tragically to her husband, had slipped one chalky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
white shoulder just a fraction of an inch too far
out of its jeweled strap. The Host, conversing
every second with exaggerated blandness about the
squirrels in Central Park, was striving frantically
all the while with a desperately surreptitious, itchy
gesture to signal to his mate. Worse than this,
a prominent Sociologist was audibly discussing the
American penal system with a worried-looking lady
whose brother was even then under indictment for
some banking fraud. Some one, trying to kick the
Sociologist's ankle bone, had snagged his own foot
gashingly through the Woodland Girl's skirt ruffle,
and the Woodland Girl, blush-blown yet with country
breezes, clear-eyed as a trout pool, sweet-breathed
as balsam, was staring panic-stricken
around the table, trying to locate the particular
man's face that could possibly connect boot-wise
with such a horridly profane accident. The sudden,
grotesque alertness of her expression attracted
the laggard interest of the young Journalist at her
left.</p>

<p>"What brought you to New York?" the Journalist
asked abruptly. "You're the last victim
in from the country, so you must give an account
of yourself. Come 'fess up! What brought you
to New York?"</p>

<p>The Journalist's smile was at least as conscientious
as the smile of daylight down a city airshaft,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and the Woodland Girl quickened to the brightening
with almost melodramatic delight, for all previous
conversational overtures from this neighbor
had been about actors that she had never heard of,
or operas that she could not even pronounce, and
before the man's scrutinizing, puzzled amazement
she had felt convicted not alone of mere rural ignorance,
but of freckles on her nose.</p>

<p>"What brought me to New York?" she repeated
with vehement new courage. "Do you
really want to know? It's quite a speech. What
brought me to New York? Why, I wanted to see
the 'heart of the city.' I'm twenty years old, and
I've never in all my life been away from home before.
Always and always I've lived in a log bungalow,
in a wild garden, in a pine forest, on a green
island, in a blue lake. My father is an invalid,
you know, one of those people who are a little
bit short of lungs but inordinately long of brains.
And I know Anglo-Saxon and Chemistry and Hindoo
History and Sunrises and Sunsets and Mountains
and Moose, and such things. But I wanted
to know People. I wanted to know Romance. I
wanted to see for myself all this 'heart of the
city' that you hear so much about&mdash;the great,
blood-red, eager, gasping heart of the city. So I
came down here last week to visit my uncle and
aunt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;The lone, accentuated figure of a boy violinist&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Her mouth tightened suddenly, and she lowered
her voice with ominous intensity. "But there <i>isn't</i>
any heart to, your city&mdash;no!&mdash;there is no heart
at all at the center of things&mdash;just a silly, pretty,
very much decorated heart-shaped box filled with
candy. If you shake it hard enough, it may rattle,
but it won't throb. And I hate&mdash;hate&mdash;hate
your old city. It's utterly, hopelessly, irremediably
jejune, and I'm going home to-morrow!" As
she leaned toward the Journalist, the gold locket
on her prim, high-necked gown swung precipitously
forth like a wall picture in a furious little earthquake.</p>

<p>The Journalist started to laugh, then changed
his mind and narrowed his eyes speculatively toward
something across the room. "No heart?"
he queried. "No Romance?"</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl followed his exploring gaze.
Between the plushy green <i>porti&egrave;res</i> a dull, cool,
rose-colored vista opened forth refreshingly, with
a fragment of bookcase, the edge of a stained
glass window, the polished gleam of a grand piano,
and then&mdash;lithe, sinuous, willowy, in the shaded
lamplight&mdash;the lone, accentuated figure of a boy
violinist. In the amazing mellow glow that smote
upon his face, the Woodland Girl noted with a
crumple at her heart the tragic droop of the boy's
dark head, the sluggish, velvet passion of his eyes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the tortured mouth, the small chin fairly worn and
burrowed away against his vibrant instrument.
And the music that burst suddenly forth was like
scalding water poured on ice&mdash;seething with anguish,
shuddering with ecstasy, flame at your heart,
frost at your spine.</p>

<p>The Girl began to shiver. "Oh, yes, I know,"
she whispered. "He plays, of course, as though
he knew all sorrows by their first names, but that's
Genius, isn't it, not Romance? He's such a little
lad. He can hardly have experienced much really
truly emotion as yet beyond a&mdash;stomach ache&mdash;or
the loss of a Henty book."</p>

<p>"A stomach ache! A Henty book!" cried the
Journalist, with a bitter, convulsive sort of mirth.
"Well, I'm ready to admit that the boy is scarcely
eighteen. But he happens to have lost a wife and
a son within the past two months! While some
of us country-born fellows of twenty-eight or thirty
were asking our patient girls at home to wait even
another year, while we came over to New York
and tried our fortunes, this little youngster of
scarcely eighteen is already a husband, a father, and
a widower.</p>

<p>"He's a Russian Jew&mdash;you can see that&mdash;and
one of our big music people picked him up
over there a few months ago and brought him
jabberingly to America. But the invitation didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
seem to include the wife and baby&mdash;genius and
family life aren't exactly guaranteed to develop
very successfully together&mdash;and right there on
the dock at the very last sailing moment the little
chap had to choose between a small, wailing family
and a great big, clapping New York&mdash;just temporarily,
you understand, a mere matter of immediate
expediency; and families are supposed to
keep indefinitely, you know, and keep sweet, too,
while everybody knows that New York can go
sour in a single night, even in the coldest weather.
And just as the youngster was trying to decide,
wavering first one way and then the other, and
calling on high every moment to the God of all the
Russias, the old steamer whistle began to blow,
and they rustled him on board, and his wife and
the kid pegged back alone to the province where
the girl's father lived, and they got snarled up on
the way with a band of Cossack soldiers, and the
little chap hasn't got any one now even as far off
as Russia to hamper his musical career....
So he's playing jig-tunes to people like us that
are trying to forget our own troubles, such as how
much we owe our tailors or our milliners. But
sometimes they say he screams in the night, and
twice he has fainted in the midst of a concert.</p>

<p>"No heart in the city? No Romance? Why,
my dear child, this whole city fairly teems with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Romance. The automobiles throb with it. The
great, roaring elevated trains go hustling full of it.
There's Romance&mdash;Romance&mdash;Romance from
dawn to dark, and from dark to dawn again. The
sweetness of the day-blooming sunshine, the madness
of the night-blooming electric lights, the
crowds, the colors, the music, the perfume&mdash;why,
the city is <i>Romance-mad!</i> If you stop anywhere
for even half an instant to get your breath, Romance
will run right over you. It's whizzing past
you in the air. It's whizzing past you in the street.
It's whizzing past you in the sensuous, ornate theaters,
in the jaded department stores, in the calm,
gray churches. Romance?&mdash;Love?</p>

<p>"The only trouble about New York Romance
lies just in the fact that it is so whizzingly premature.
You've simply got to grab Love the minute
before you've made up your mind&mdash;because the
minute after you've made up your mind, it won't
be there. Grab it&mdash;or lose it. Grab it&mdash;or lose
it. That's the whole Heart-Motto of New York.
Sinner or Saint&mdash;<span class="smcap">rush</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">rush</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">rush</span>&mdash;like
Hell!"</p>

<p>"Grab it&mdash;or lose it. Grab it, or&mdash;l-o-s-e it."
Like the impish raillery of a tortured devil, the violin's
passionate, wheedling tremolo seemed to catch
up the phrase, and mouth it and mock it, and tear
it and tease it, and kiss it and curse it&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">smash</span> it at last into a great, screeching crescendo
that rent your eardrums like the crash of steel
rails.</p>

<p>With strangely parched lips, the Woodland Girl
stretched out her small brown hand to the fragile,
flower-stemmed glass, and tasted for the first time
in her life the sweety-sad, molten-gold magic of
champagne. "Why, what is it?" she asked, with
the wonder still wet on her lips. "Why, what
is it?"</p>

<p>The Journalist raised his own glass with staler
fingers, and stared for a second through narrowing
eyes into the shimmering vintage. "What is
it?" he repeated softly. "This particular brand?
The Italians call it '<i>Lacrym&aelig; Christi</i>.' So even
in our furies and our follies, in our caf&eacute;s and carousals,
in our love and all our laughter&mdash;we drink&mdash;you
see&mdash;the&mdash;'Tears of Christ.'" He
reached out suddenly and covered the Girl's half-drained
glass with a quivering hand. "Excuse
me," he stammered. "Maybe&mdash;our thirst is
partly of the soul; but '<i>Lacrym&aelig; Christi</i>' was
never meant for little girls like you. <i>Go back to
your woods!</i>"</p>

<p>Scuttle as it might, the precipitate, naked passion
in his voice did not quite have time to cover itself
with word-clothes. A little gasping breath escaped.
And though the Girl's young life was as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
shiningly empty as an unfinished house, her brain-cells
were packed like an attic with all the inherent
experiences of her mother's mother's mother, and
she flinched instinctively with a great lurch of her
heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's talk about something&mdash;dressy," she
begged. "Let's talk about Central Park. Let's
talk about the shops. Let's talk about the subway."
Her startled face broke desperately into
a smile. "Oh, don't you think the subway is perfectly
dreadful," she insisted. "There's so much
underbrush in it!" Even as she spoke, her shoulders
hunched up the merest trifle, and her head
pushed forward, after the manner of people who
walk much in the deep woods. The perplexity in
her eyes spread instantly to her hands. Among the
confusing array of knives and forks and spoons
at her plate, her fingers began to snarl nervously
like a city man's feet through a tangle of blackberry
vines.</p>

<p>With a good-natured shrug of his shoulders, the
Journalist turned to his more sophisticated neighbor,
and left her quite piteously alone once more.
An enamored-looking man and woman at her right
were talking transmigration of souls, but whenever
she tried to annex herself to their conversation
they trailed their voices away from her in a sacred,
aloof sort of whisper. Across the table the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
were discussing city politics in a most clandestine
sort of an undertone. Altogether it was almost
half an hour before the Journalist remembered to
smile at her again. The very first flicker of his
lips started her red mouth mumbling inarticulately.</p>

<p>"Were you going to say something?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head drearily. "No," she stammered.
"I've tried and tried, but I can't think
of anything at all to say. I guess I don't know any
secrets."</p>

<p>The Journalist's keen eyes traveled shrewdly for
a second round the cautious, worldly-wise table,
and then came narrowing back rather quizzically
to the Woodland Girl's flushing, pink and white
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he smiled. "You look to
me like a little girl who might have a good many
secrets."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No," she insisted, "in
all the whole wide world I don't know one single
thing that has to be whispered."</p>

<p>"No scandals?" teased the Journalist.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"No love affairs?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>The Journalist laughed. "Why, what do you
think about all day long up in your woods?" he
quizzed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anglo-Saxon and Chemistry and Hindoo History
and Sunsets and Mountains and Moose," she
repeated glibly.</p>

<p>"Now you're teasing me," said the Journalist.</p>

<p>She nodded her head delightedly. "I'm trying
to!" she smiled.</p>

<p>The Journalist turned part way round in his
chair, and proffered her a perfectly huge olive as
though it had been a crown jewel. When he spoke
again, his voice was almost as low as the voice of
the man who was talking transmigration of souls.
But his smile was a great deal kinder. "Don't
you find any Romance at all in your woods?" he
asked a bit drawlingly.</p>

<p>"No," said the Girl; "that's the trouble. Of
course, when I was small it didn't make any difference;
indeed, I think that I rather preferred it
lonesome then. But this last year, somehow, and
this last autumn especially&mdash;oh, I know you'll
think I'm silly&mdash;but two or three times in the
woods&mdash;I've hoped and hoped and hoped&mdash;at
the turn of a trail, or the edge of a brook, or the
scent of a camp fire&mdash;that I might run right into
a real, live Hunter or Fisherman. And&mdash;one
night I really prayed about it&mdash;and the next morning
I got up early and put on my very best little
hunting suit&mdash;all coats and leggings and things
just like yours, you know&mdash;and I stayed out all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
day long&mdash;tramping&mdash;tramping&mdash;tramping, and
I never saw <i>any one</i>. But I did get a fox. Yes!&mdash;and
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then what?" whispered the Journalist very
helpfully.</p>

<p>The Girl began to smile, but her lips were quite
as red as a blush. "Well&mdash;and&mdash;then," she continued
softly, "it occurred to me all of a sudden
that the probable reason why the Man-Who-Was-Meant-for-Me
didn't come was because he&mdash;<i>didn't
know I was there!</i>" She began to laugh,
toying all the while a little bit nervously with her
ice-cream fork. "So I thought that perhaps&mdash;if
I came down to New York this winter&mdash;and
then went home again, that maybe&mdash;not probably
you know, but just possibly&mdash;some time
in the spring or summer&mdash;I might look up suddenly
through the trees and he <i>would</i> be there!
But I've been ten days in New York and I haven't
seen one single man whom I'd exactly like to meet
in the woods&mdash;in my little hunting suit."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you be willing to meet me?" pried
the Journalist injudiciously.</p>

<p>The Girl looked up and faltered. "Why, of
course," she hurried, "I should be very glad to see
you&mdash;but I had always sort of hoped that the
man whom I met in the woods wouldn't be bald."</p>

<p>The Journalist choked noisily over his salted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
almonds. His heightened color made him look
very angry.</p>

<p>"Oh, I trust I wasn't rude," begged the Woodland
Girl. Then as the Journalist's galloping
laughter slowed down into the gentlest sort of a
single-foot smile, her eyes grew abruptly big and
dark with horror. "Why, I never thought of it,"
she stammered, "but I suppose that what I have
just said about the man in the woods and my coming
to New York is&mdash;'husband hunting.'"</p>

<p>The Journalist considered the matter very carefully.
"N&mdash;o," he answered at last, "I don't
think I should call it 'husband hunting' nor yet,
exactly, 'the search for the Holy Grail'; but, really
now, I think on the whole I should call it more of
a sacrament than a sport."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;h," whispered the Girl with a little sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>It must have been fully fifteen minutes before
the Journalist spoke to her again. Then, in the
midst of his salad course, he put down his fork
and asked quite inquisitively: "Aren't there
any men at all up in your own special Maine
woods?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," the Girl acknowledged with a little
crinkle of her nose, "there's Peter."</p>

<p>"Who's Peter?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter," she explained, "is the Philadelphia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
boy who tutors with my father in the summers."</p>

<p>Her youthfulness was almost as frank as fever,
and, though taking advantage of this frankness
seemed quite as reprehensible as taking advantage of
any other kind of babbling delirium, the Journalist
felt somehow obliged to pursue his investigations.</p>

<p>"Nice boy?" he suggested tactfully.</p>

<p>The Girl's nose crinkled just a little bit tighter.</p>

<p>The Journalist frowned. "I'll wager you two
dozen squirrels out of Central Park," he said, "that
Peter is head over heels in love with you!"</p>

<p>The Girl's mouth twisted a trifle, but her eyes
were absolutely solemn. "I suppose that he is,"
she answered gravely, "but he's never taken the
trouble to tell me so, and he's been with us three
summers. I suppose lots of men are made like
that. You read about it in books. They want to
sew just as long&mdash;long&mdash;long a seam as they
possibly can without tying any knot in the thread.
Peter, I know, wants to make perfectly Philadelphia-sure
that he won't meet any girl in the winters
whom he likes better."</p>

<p>"I think that sort of thing is mighty mean," interposed
the Journalist sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Mean?" cried the Girl. "Mean?" Her
tousley yellow hair seemed fairly electrified with astonishment,
and her big blue eyes brimmed suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
with uproarious delight. "Oh, of course," she
added contritely, "it may be mean for the person
who sews the seam, but it's heaps of fun for the
cloth, because after awhile, you know, Pompous
Peter will discover that there isn't any winter girl
whom he likes better, and in the general excitement
of the discovery he'll remember only the long, long
seam&mdash;three happy summers&mdash;and forget altogether
that he never tied any knot. And then!
And then!" her cheeks began to dimple. "And
then&mdash;just as he begins triumphantly to gather me
in&mdash;all my yards and yards and yards of beautiful
freedom fretted into one short, puckery, worried
ruffle&mdash;then&mdash;Hooray&mdash;swish&mdash;slip&mdash;slide&mdash;<i>out
comes the thread</i>&mdash;and Mr. Peter falls
right over bump-backward with surprise. Won't
it be fun?"</p>

<p>"Fun?" snapped the Journalist. "What a horrid,
heartless little cynic you are!"</p>

<p>The Girl's eyebrows fairly tiptoed to reach his
meaning. "Cynic?" she questioned. "You surely
don't mean that I am a cynic? Why, I think men
are perfectly splendid in every possible way that&mdash;doesn't
matter to a woman. They can build
bridges and wage wars, and spell the hardest, homeliest
words. But Peter makes life so puzzling,"
she added wryly. "Everybody wants me to marry
Peter; everybody says 'slow but sure,' 'slow but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sure.' But it's a lie!" she cried out hotly. "Slow
is <i>not</i> sure. It is not! It is not! The man who
isn't excited enough to <i>run</i> to his goal is hardly
interested enough to walk. And yet"&mdash;her forehead
crinkled all up with worry&mdash;"and yet&mdash;you
tell me that 'quick' isn't sure, either. <i>What is
sure?</i>"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" said the Journalist.</p>

<p>She tossed her head. "All the same," she retorted,
"I'd rather have a man propose to me
three years before, rather than three years after,
I'd made up my mind whether to accept him or
not."</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;marry&mdash;Peter," laughed the Journalist.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked&mdash;so very bluntly that
the Journalist twisted a bit uneasily.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I&mdash;don't&mdash;know," he answered cautiously.
Then suddenly his face brightened.
"Any trout fishing up in your brooks about the
first of May?" he asked covertly.</p>

<p>Again the knowledge of her mother's mother's
mother blazed red-hot in the Girl's cheeks.
"Y&mdash;e&mdash;s," she faltered reluctantly, "the trout-fishing
is very generous in May."</p>

<p>"Will Peter be there?" persisted the Journalist.</p>

<p>Her eyes began to shine again with amusement.
"Oh, no," she said. "Peter never comes until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
July." With mock dignity she straightened herself
up till her shoulder almost reached the Journalist's.
"I was very foolish," she attested, "even
to mention Peter, or mankind&mdash;at all. Of course,
I'm commencing to realize that my ideas about
men are exceedingly countrified&mdash;'disgustingly
countrified,' my aunt tells me. Why, just this last
week at my aunt's sewing club I learned that the
only two real qualifications for marriage are that a
man should earn not less than a hundred dollars a
week, and be a perfectly kind hooker."</p>

<p>"A perfectly kind hooker?" queried the Journalist.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she said. "Don't you know&mdash;now&mdash;that
all our dresses fasten in the back?"
Her little tinkling, giggling laugh rang out with
startling incongruity through the formal room, and
her uncle glanced at her and frowned with the
slightest perceptible flicker of irritation. She
leaned her face a wee bit closer to the Journalist.
"Now, uncle, for instance," she confided, "is not
a particularly kind hooker. He's accurate, you
understand, but not exactly kind."</p>

<p>The Journalist started to smile, but instantly
her tip-most finger ends brushed across his sleeve.
"Oh, please, don't smile any more," she pleaded,
"because every time you smile you look so pleasant
that some lady sticks out a remark like a hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and grabs you into her own conversation." But
the warning came too late. In another moment
the Journalist was most horridly involved with the
people on his left in a prosy discussion regarding
Japanese servants.</p>

<p>For another interminable length of time the
Woodland Girl sat in absolute isolation. Some of
the funerals at home were vastly more social, she
thought&mdash;people at least inquired after the health
of the survivors. But now, even after she had
shredded all her lettuce into a hundred pieces and
bitten each piece twice, she was still quite alone.
Even after she had surreptitiously nibbled up all
the cracker crumbs around her own plate and the
Journalist's plate, she was still quite alone. Finally,
in complete despair, she folded her little,
brown, ringless hands and sat and stared frankly
about her.</p>

<p>Across the sparkly, rose-reeking table a man as
polished as poison ivy was talking devotedly to a
white-faced Beauty in a most exciting gown that
looked for all the world like the Garden of Eden
struck by lightning&mdash;black and billowing as a
thunder cloud, zigzagged with silver, ravished with
rose-petals, rain-dropped with pearls. Out of the
gorgeous, mysterious confusion of it the Beauty's
bare shoulders leaped away like Eve herself fleeing
before the storm. But beyond the extravagant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
sweep of gown and shoulder the primitive likeness
ended abruptly in one of those utterly well-bred,
worldly-wise, perfected young faces, with that subtle,
indescribable sex-consciousness of expression
which makes the type that men go mad over, and
the type that older women tersely designate as looking
just a little bit "too kissed."</p>

<p>But the Woodland Girl did not know the
crumpled-rose-leaf stamp of face which characterizes
the coquette. Utterly fascinated, tremulous
with excitement, heartsick with envy, she reached
out very softly and knocked with her finger on the
Journalist's plate to beg readmission to his mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, who is that beautiful creature?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Adele Reitzen," said the Journalist, "your
uncle's ward."</p>

<p>"My own uncle's ward?" The Woodland Girl
gave a little gasp. "But why does she worry so
in her eyes every now and then?" she asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>Even as she asked, Adele Reitzen began to cough.
The trouble started with a trivial clearing of her
throat, caught up a disjointed swallow or two, and
ended with a rack that seemed to rip like a brutal
knife right across her silver-spangled lungs. Somebody
patted her on the back. Somebody offered
her a glass of water. But in the midst of the choking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
paroxysm she asked to be excused for a moment
and slipped away to the dressing-room. The
very devoted man seemed rather piteously worried
by the incident, and the Hostess looked straight
into his eyes and shook her head ominously.</p>

<p>"I hope you are planning a southern wedding trip
next week," she said. "I don't like that cough
of Adele's. I've sat at three dinner parties with
her this week, and each individual night she has
had an attack like this and been obliged to leave the
table."</p>

<p>In the moment's lull, the butler presented a yellow
telegram on a shiny, Sheffield tray, and the
Hostess slipped her pink fingers rustlingly through
the envelope and brightened instantly. "Oh,
here's a surprise for you, Chloe," she called to the
Woodland Girl. "Peter is coming over to-night
to see you." Like a puckering electric tingle the
simple announcement seemed to run through the
room, and a little wise, mischievous smile spread
from face to face among the guests. In another
instant everybody turned and peeped at the Woodland
Girl, and the Woodland Girl felt her good
cool, red blood turn suddenly to bubbling, boiling
water, and steam in horrid, clammy wetness across
her forehead and along the prickling palms of her
hands, and the Journalist laughed right out loud,
and the whole green, definite room swam dizzily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
like the flaunting scarlet messiness of a tropical
jungle.</p>

<p>Every nook and corner of the house, indeed, was
luxuriously heated, but when Adele Reitzen came
sauntering back to her seat, pungent around her,
telltale as an alien perfume, lurked the chill, fresh
aroma of the wintry, blustering street. Only the
country girl's smothering lungs noted the astonishing
fact. Like a little caged animal scenting the
blessed outdoors, her nostrils began to crinkle, and
she straightened up with such abrupt alertness that
she loomed to Adele Reitzen's startled senses like
the only visible person at the table, and for just
the fraction of a heart-beat the two girls fathomed
down deep and understandingly into each other's
eyes, before Adele Reitzen fluttered her white
lids with a little piteous gesture of appeal.</p>

<p>Breathlessly the Woodland Girl turned to the
Journalist, and touched his arm. "New York <i>is</i>
interesting, isn't it!" she stammered. "I've decided
just this minute to stay another week."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho," said the Journalist. "So you love it
better than you did an hour ago?"</p>

<p>"No!" cried the Woodland Girl. "I love it
worse. I love it worse every moment like a&mdash;ghost
story, but I'm going to stick it out a week
longer and see how it ends. And I've learned one
clue to New York's plot this very night. I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
learned that most every face is a 'haunted house.'
The mouths slam back and forth all the time like
pleasant doors, and the jolliest kind of speeches
come prancing out, and all that&mdash;but in the eyes
ghosts are peering out the windows every minute."</p>

<p>"Cheerful thought," said the Journalist, taking
off his glasses. "Who's the ghost in my eyes?"</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl stared at him wonderingly.
"The ghost in your eyes?" she blundered. "Why&mdash;I
guess&mdash;it's 'the patient girl at home' whom
you asked to wait 'even another year.'"</p>

<p>Like two fever spots the red flared angrily on the
Journalist's cheek bones.</p>

<p>Not even the Journalist spoke to her again.</p>

<p>Finally, lonesome as a naughty child, she followed
the dozen dinner guests back into the huge
drawing-room, and wandered aimlessly around
through the incomprehensible mysteries of Chinese
idols and teakwood tabourets and soft, mushy
Asiatic rugs. Then at last, behind a dark, jutting
bookcase, in a corner most blissfully safe and secret
like a cave, she stumbled suddenly upon a great,
mottled leopard skin with its big, humpy head, and
its sad glass eyes yearning out to her reproachfully.
As though it had been a tiny, lost kitten, she gave
a wee gasp of joy, and dropped down on the floor
and tried to cuddle the huge, felt-lined, fur bulk
into her lap. Just as the clumsy face flopped across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
her knees, she heard the quick swish of silk, and
looked up to see Adele Reitzen bending over her.</p>

<p>The older girl's eyes were tortured with worry,
and her white fingers teased perpetually at the jeweled
watch on her breast. "Chloe Curtis," she
whispered abruptly, "will you do something for
me? Would you be afraid? You are visiting here
in the house, so no one would question your disappearance.
Will you go up to the dressing-room&mdash;quick&mdash;and
get my black evening coat&mdash;the one
with the gold embroidery and the big hood&mdash;and
go out to the street corner where the cars stop&mdash;and
tell the man who is waiting there&mdash;that I
couldn't&mdash;simply couldn't&mdash;get out again?
Would you be afraid?"</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl jumped to her feet. At that
particular instant the lump in her throat seemed the
only really insurmountable obstacle in the whole
wide world. "Would I be afraid?" she scoffed.
"Afraid of what? Of New York? Of the electric
lights? Of the automobiles? Of the cross policemen?
Afraid of nothing!" Her voice lowered
suddenly. "Is it&mdash;Love?" she whispered.</p>

<p>The older girl's face was piteous to see.
"Y&mdash;e&mdash;s," she stammered. "It is Love."</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl's eyes grew big with wonder.
"But the other man?" she gasped. "You are
going to be married next week!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Adele Reitzen's eyes blurred. "Yes," she repeated,
"I am going to be married next week." A
little shiver went flickering across her shoulders.</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl's heart began to plunge and
race. "What's the matter with the man out on
the street corner?" she asked nervously.</p>

<p>Adele Reitzen caught her breath. "He's a civil
engineer," she said. "His name is Brian Baird.
He's just back from Central America. I met him
on the steamer once. He was traveling second
cabin. My&mdash;family&mdash;won't&mdash;let&mdash;me&mdash;have&mdash;him."</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl threw back her head and
laughed, and smothered her laugh contritely with
her hand. "Your family won't let you have him?"
she mumbled. "What a funny idea! What
has your family got to do about it?" Her breath
began to quicken, and she reached out suddenly and
clutched Adele Reitzen's shoulder. "Do you know
where my uncle's musty old law library is?" she
hurried. "It's downstairs, you know, close to the
store room&mdash;nobody ever uses it. You go down
there just as fast as you possibly can, and wait
there, and I'll be back in five minutes with the&mdash;Love
Man."</p>

<p>Before Adele Reitzen's feebler courage could protest,
the Woodland Girl was scurrying up the short
flight to the dressing-room and pawing like a prankish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
terrier through the neatly folded evening coats
that snuggled across the bed. Tingling with excitement,
she arrayed herself finally in the luxuriantly
muffling black and gold splendor, and started cautiously
down the long, creaky front stairs.</p>

<p>Like the inimitable, familiar thrill of little wild,
phosphorescent eyes looming suddenly out of the
black night-woods at home, the adventure challenged
her impetuous curiosity. Bored puzzlingly
by the big city's utter inability to reproduce the
identical, simple lake-and-forest emotionalism that
was the breath of life to her, she quickened now
precipitately to the possible luring mystery in human
eyes. Through the dark mahogany stripes of
the balustrade, the drawing-room candles flared and
sputtered like little finger-pinches of fluid flame,
and the violin's shuddering voice chased after her,
taunting, "Hurry! Hurry! Or it won't be there!"
Beyond the lights and music, and the friendly creaking
stairs, the strange black night opened forth like
the scariest sort of a bottomless pit; but as yet, in
all the girl's twenty coltish years nothing except
headache and heart-beat had ever made her feel perfectly
throbbing-positive that she was alive. She
could spare the headache, but she could not spare the
heart-beat. Paddling with muscle-strained shoulder
and heaving breast across a November-tortured lake,
or huddling under forbidden pine trees in a rackety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
August thunder storm, or floundering on broken
snowshoes into the antlered presence of an astounded
moose&mdash;Fun and Fear were synonymous
to her.</p>

<p>Once on the street, like water to thirst, the cold
night air freshened and vivified her. Over her head
the electric lights twinkled giddily like real stars.
On either side of her the huge, hulking houses
reared up like pleasant imitation mountains. Her
trailing cloak slipped now and then from her clutching
fingers, but she trudged along toward the corner
with just one simple, supreme sense of pleasurable
excitement&mdash;somewhere out of the unfathomed
shadows a real, live Adventure was going
to rise up and scare her.</p>

<p>But the man, when he came, did not scare her one
hundredth part as much as she scared him, though
he jumped at her from the snuggling fur robe of a
stranded automobile, and snatched at her arm with
an almost bruising intensity.</p>

<p>"Oh, Adele," he cried huskily, "I thought you
had failed me again."</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl threw back her somber hood
and stood there all blonde and tousle-haired and
astonishing under the electric light. "I'm not your
Adele," she explained breathlessly. "I'm just
Chloe Curtis. Adele sent me out to tell you that
she absolutely couldn't&mdash;couldn't come. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
yourself would have seen that it was horridly impossible.
But you are to go back to the house now
with me&mdash;to my uncle's old unused library and see
Adele yourself for as much as fifteen minutes. No
one&mdash;oh, I'm sure that no one&mdash;could persuade
a woman to be brave&mdash;on a street corner; but I
think that perhaps if you had a chance to see
Adele all alone, she would be very&mdash;extraordinarily
brave."</p>

<p>Anger, resentment, confusion, dismay flared like
successive explosions in the man's face, and faded
again, leaving his flesh utter ash gray.</p>

<p>"It was plucky of you to come," he muttered
grimly, "but I haven't quite reached the point yet&mdash;thank
you&mdash;where I go sneaking round people's
unused rooms to meet any one!"</p>

<p>"Is it so very different from sneaking round
street corners?" said the Woodland Girl.</p>

<p>The man's head lifted proudly. "I don't go
'sneaking' round street corners," he answered simply.
"All Outdoors <i>belongs</i> to me! But I won't
go secretly to any house that doesn't welcome me."</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl began to stamp her foot.
"But the house does welcome you," she insisted.
"It's my visity-house, and you are to come there as
my friend."</p>

<p>In her ardor she turned and faced him squarely
under the light, and winced to see how well worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
facing he was&mdash;for the husband of a coward.
There was no sleek New York about him, certainly,
but rather the merge of all cities and many countries,
a little breath of unusualness, a touch of mystery,
a trifling suggestion, perhaps, of more dusty
roads than smug pavements, twenty-eight or thirty
years, surely, of adventurous youth. Impulsively
she put out her hand to him. "Oh, please come,"
she faltered. "I&mdash;think you are so nice."</p>

<p>With a little laugh that had no amusement in it,
nor pleasure, nor expectation, nor any emotion that
the Woodland Girl had ever experienced, he stood
and stared at her with some sudden impulse.
"Does Adele really want me to come?" he asked
trenchantly.</p>

<p>"Why yes," insisted the Woodland Girl. "It's
life or death for you and Adele."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, standing on guard at the edge
of the library door, the Woodland Girl heard, for
the first time in her life, the strange, low, vibrant,
mysterious mate-tone of a human voice. If she had
burrowed her head in a dozen pillows, she could not
have failed to sense the amazing wonder of the
sound, though the clearer-worded detail of hurried
plans and eager argument and radiant acquiescence
passed by her unobserved. "But I must be perfectly
sure that you love me," persisted the man's voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"You and&mdash;you only," echoed the woman's passion.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, like a practical joke sprung by a
half-witted Fate, the store room door opened with
casual, exploring pleasantness, and the Journalist
and Adele Reitzen's promised husband and big Peter
himself stepped out into the hallway.</p>

<p>Before the surprised greeting in two men's faces
the Woodland Girl retreated step by step, until at
last with a quick turn she whirled back into the
dingy, gas-lit library&mdash;her chalky face, her staring
eyes proclaiming only too plainly the calamity which
she had no time to stuff into words.</p>

<p>Close behind her followed the three smiling, unsuspicious
intruders. Even then the incident might
have passed without gross awkwardness if the
Woodland Girl's uncle and aunt had not suddenly
joined the company. From the angry, outraged
flush on the two older faces it was perfectly evident
that these two, at least, had been waylaid by kitchen
gossip.</p>

<p>Brian Baird laughed. Like a manly lover goaded
and hectored and cajoled too long into unworthy
secrecy, his pulses fairly jumped to meet the frank,
forced issue. But with a quick, desperate appeal
Adele Reitzen silenced the triumphant speech on his
lips. "Let me manage it!" she whispered, so vehemently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
that the man yielded to her, and stepped
back against the fireplace, and spread his arms with
studied, indolent ease along the mantel, like a rustic
cross tortured out of a supple willow withe. One
of his hands played teasingly with a stale spray of
Christmas greens. Nothing but the straining,
white-knuckled grip of his other hand modified the
absolute, wilful insolence of his pose.</p>

<p>As for Adele, her face was ghastly.</p>

<p>With crude, uncontrolled venom the Woodland
Girl's aunt plunged into the emergency. "Adele,"
she cried shrilly, "I think you owe your <i>fianc&eacute;</i> an
explanation! You promised us faithfully last year
that you would never, never see Mr. Baird again&mdash;and
now to-night our chauffeur saw you steal out to
the street corner to meet him&mdash;like a common
shop-girl. And you dare to bring him back&mdash;to
my house! What have you to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>For the fraction of a moment Adele Reitzen's
superb beauty straightened up to its full majestic
height, and all the love-pride that was in her white,
white flesh flamed gloriously in her face. Then her
sleek, prosperous, arrogant city lover stepped suddenly
forward where the yellow light struck bleakly
across his shrewd, small eyes and his thin, relentless
mouth.</p>

<p>"I should be very glad, indeed, to hear what you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
have to say," he announced, and his voice was like
a nicked knife blade.</p>

<p>Flush by flush by flush the red glory fled from
Adele Reitzen's face. Her throat began to flutter.
Her knees crumpled under her. Fear went over her
like a gray fog.</p>

<p>With one despairing hand she reached back to the
Woodland Girl. "Oh, tell them it was you," she
whispered hotly. "Oh, tell them it was you." Her
scared face brightened viciously. "It <i>was</i> you&mdash;you
know! Tell them&mdash;oh, tell them anything&mdash;only
save me!"</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl's eyes were big with horror.
She started to speak, she started to protest, but before
the jumbled words could leave her lips Adele
Reitzen turned to the others and blurted out hysterically:</p>

<p>"Surely I can't be expected to keep even a love-secret
under these&mdash;distressing circumstances. <i>It
was Chloe who went out to the street corner to-night&mdash;like
a common shop-girl&mdash;to meet Brian
Baird. She wore my cloak on purpose to disguise
her.</i>"</p>

<p>Like the blaring scream of a discordant trumpet,
the treacherous, flatted truth crashed into the Woodland
Girl's startled senses, and the man in the shape
of a sagging willow cross started up and cried out,
"My God!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>For a second the Woodland Girl stood staring
into his dreadful, chaotic face, then she squared her
shoulders and turned to meet the wrathful, contemptuous
surprise in her uncle's and aunt's features.</p>

<p>"So it was you," sneered the uncle, "embroiling
our decent household in a common, vulgar intrigue?"</p>

<p>"So it was you," flamed her aunt, "you who have
been posing all these days as an Innocent?"</p>

<p>Frantic with perplexity, muddled with fear, torn
by conflicting chivalries, the Woodland Girl stared
back and forth from Adele Reitzen's agonized plea
to the grim, inscrutable gleam in Brian Baird's eyes.
As though every living, moving verb had been
ripped out of that night's story, and all the inflexible
nouns were printing themselves slam-bang one on
top of another&mdash;Roses, Wine, Music, Silver, Diamonds,
Fir-Balsam telescoped each other in her
senses.</p>

<p>"Your father sent you down here," persisted her
aunt brutally, "on the private plea to me that he
was planning to be married again&mdash;but I can readily
see that perhaps no one would exactly want
you."</p>

<p>The Woodland Girl's heart began to pound.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;are&mdash;waiting," prodded her uncle's icy
voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the Girl's memory quickened. Once,
long ago, her father had said to her: "Little
Daughter, if you are ever in fear and danger by sea
or land&mdash;or city, which is neither sea nor land&mdash;turn
always to that man, and to that man only,
whom you would trust in the deep woods. Put
your imagination to work, not your reason. You
have no reason!"</p>

<p>Desperately she turned to Peter. His face,
robbed utterly of its affection, was all a-shock with
outraged social proprieties, merging the merest bit
unpleasantly into the racy appreciation of a unique
adventure. Panic-stricken, she turned to the Journalist.
Already across the Journalist's wine-flushed
face the pleasant, friendly smile was souring into
worldly skepticism and mocking disillusionment.</p>

<p>She shut her eyes. "O Big Woods, help me!"
she prayed. "O Cross Storm, warn me! O Rough
Trail, guide me!"</p>

<p>Behind her tightly scrunched lids her worried
brain darkened like a jumbled midnight forest.
Jaded, bedraggled, aching with storm and terror,
she saw herself stumbling into the sudden dazzling
splurge of a stranger's camp fire. Was it a man
like Peter? Was it the Journalist? She began to
shiver. Then her heart gave a queer, queer jump,
and she opened her eyes stark wide and searched
deep into Brian Baird's livid face. One of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
hands still strained at the wooden mantel. The
other still bruised the pungent balsam tip between its
restive fingers. His young hair was too gray about
his temples. His shoulders were too tired with
life's pack burdens. His eyes had probably grown
more bitter that night than any woman's lips could
ever sweeten again. And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Down from the far-away music room floated the
quavering, passionate violin wail of the boy who had
dared to temporize with Fate. Up from the close-nudging
street crashed the confusing slap of hoofs
and the mad whir of wheels racing not so much for
the Joy of the Destination as for the Thrill of the
Journey. She gave a little gasping sob, and Brian
Baird stooped forward incredulously, as though
from the yellow glare of his camp fire he had only
just that instant sensed the faltering footfall of a
wayfarer in acute distress, and could scarcely distinguish
even yet through the darkness the detailed
features of the apparition.</p>

<p>For a second, startled eyes defied startled eyes, and
then suddenly, out of his own meager ration of
faith or fortune or immediate goodness, the man
straightened up, and <i>smiled</i>&mdash;the simple, honest,
unquestioning camp-fire smile&mdash;the smile of food
and blanket, the smile of welcome, the smile of shelter,
the signal of the gladly-shared crust&mdash;and the
Woodland Girl gave a low, wild cry of joy, and ran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
across the room to him, and wheeled back against
him, close, tight, with her tousled hair grazing his
haggard cheek and her brown hands clutching hard
at the sweep of his arms along the mantel.</p>

<p>"Adele Reitzen is right," she cried out triumphantly.
"This is my&mdash;man!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE PINK SASH</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/drop_n.png" width="165" height="164" alt="N" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />O man could have asked the question
more simply. The whole
gaunt, gigantic Rocky Mountain
landscape seemed indeed most peculiarly
conducive to simple emotions.</div>

<p>Yet Donas Guthrie's original remark had been
purely whimsical and distinctly apropos of nothing
at all. The careless knocking of his pipe against
the piazza's primitive railing had certainly not prepared
the way for any particularly vital statement.</p>

<p>"Up&mdash;to&mdash;the&mdash;time&mdash;he's&mdash;thirty,"
drawled the pleasant, deep, distinctly masculine
voice, "up&mdash;to&mdash;the&mdash;time&mdash;he's&mdash;thirty, no
man has done the things that he's really wanted to
do&mdash;but only the things that happened to come his
way. He's forced into business to please his father,
and cajoled into the Episcopal Church to gratify his
mother, and bullied into red neckties to pacify his
sister Isabel. But once having reached the grown-up,
level-headed, utterly independent age of thirty,
a man's a fool, I tell you, who doesn't sit down deliberately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and roll up his sleeves, and square his
jaw, and list out, one by one, the things that <i>he</i>
wants in the presumable measure of lifetime that's
left him&mdash;and go ahead and get them!"</p>

<p>"Why, surely," said the young woman, without
the slightest trace of surprise. Something in her
matter-of-fact acquiescence made Donas Guthrie
smile a trifle shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Oh! So you've got your own list all made
out?" he quizzed. Around the rather tired-looking
corners of Esther Davidson's mouth the tiniest possible
flicker of amusement began to show.</p>

<p>"No, not all made out," she answered frankly.
"You see, I wasn't thirty&mdash;until yesterday."</p>

<p>Stooping with cheerful unconcern to blow a little
fluff of tobacco ash from his own khaki-colored
knees to hers, Guthrie eyed her delightedly from
under his heavy brows.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is working out very neatly and pleasantly,"
he mused, all agrin. "Ever since you joined
our camping party at Laramie, jumping off the train
as white-faced and out of breath as though you'd
been running to catch up with us all the way from
Boston&mdash;indeed, ever since you first wrote me at
Morristown, asking full particulars about the whole
expedition and begging us to go to the Sierra Nevadas
instead and blotted 'Sierra' twice and crossed
it out once&mdash;and then in final petulance spelled it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
with three 'r's,' I've been utterly consumed with
curiosity to know just how old you are."</p>

<p>"Thirty years&mdash;and one morning," said the
young woman&mdash;absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"W-h-e-w!" gasped Guthrie. "But that's a
ripe old age! Surely, you've no time to lose!"</p>

<p>Rummaging through his pockets with mock intensity
he thrust into her hands, at last, a small pad
of paper and a pencil.</p>

<p>"Now quick!" he insisted. "Make out your
list before it's too late to profit by it!"</p>

<p>The woman was evidently perfectly willing to
comply with every playful aspect of his mood, but it
was equally evident that she did not intend to be
hurried about it. Quite perversely she began to
dally with the pencil.</p>

<p>"But, you see, I don't know exactly just what
kind of a list you mean," she protested.</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks!" laughed the man. "Here, give
me the paper! Now&mdash;head it like this: 'I, Esther
Davidson, spinster, <i>&aelig;t.</i> thirty years and a few minutes
over, do hereby promise and attest that no matter
how unwilling to die I may be when my time
comes, I shall, at least, not feel that life has defrauded
me if I have succeeded in achieving and
possessing the following brief list of experiences
and substances.' There!" he finished triumphantly.
"Now do you see how easy and business-like it all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
is? Just the plainest possible rating of the things
you'd like to have before you're willing to die."</p>

<p>Cautiously Esther Davidson took the paper from
his hand and scanned it with slow-smiling eyes.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;things&mdash;I'd&mdash;like to have&mdash;before
I'm&mdash;willing&mdash;to&mdash;die," she mused indolently.
Then suddenly into her placid face blazed an astonishing
flame of passion that vanished again as
quickly as it came. "My God!" she said. "The
things I've <i>got</i> to have before I'm willing to die!"</p>

<p>Stretching the little paper taut across her knees,
she began to scribble hasty, impulsive words and
phrases, crossing and recrossing, making and erasing,
now frowning fiercely down on the unoffending
page, now staring off narrow-eyed and smilingly
speculative into the blue-green spruce tops.</p>

<p>It was almost ten minutes before she spoke again.
Then: "How do you spell amethyst?" she asked
meditatively.</p>

<p>The man gave a groan of palpable disgust.
"Oh, I say," he reproached her. "You're not
playing fair! This was to be a really <i>bona fide</i>
statement you know."</p>

<p>Without looking up the young woman lifted her
hand and gesticulated across the left side of her
mannish, khaki-colored flannel shirt.</p>

<p>"Cross my heart!" she affirmed solemnly.
"This is a perfectly 'honest-injun' list!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she tore up everything she had written and
began all over again, astonishingly slowly, astonishingly
neatly, on a fresh sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"Of course, at first," she explained painstakingly,
"you think there are just about ten thousand things
that you've simply got to have, but when you really
stop to sort them out, and pick and choose a bit,
and narrow them all down to actual essentials; narrow
them all down to just the 'Passions of the
Soul,' as it were, why, then, there really aren't so
many after all! Only one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight," she counted on her fingers. "At
first, for instance," she persisted frankly, "it seemed
to me that I could never, never die happy until I had
possessed a very large&mdash;oh, I mean an inordinately
large amethyst brooch that simply wallowed in
pearls, but honestly now as a real treasure-trove, I
can see that I'd infinitely rather be able to remember
that once upon a time I'd&mdash;stroked a lion's
face; just one, long, slow, soft-furred, yellow stroke
from the browny-pink tip of his nose to the extremest
shaggy end of his mane&mdash;and he hadn't bitten
me!"</p>

<p>"My Heavens!" gasped the man. "Are you
crazy? What kind of a list have you been making
out anyway?"</p>

<p>A little acridly she thrust both her list and her
hands into the side pockets of her riding skirt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"What kind of a list did you think I would make
out?" she asked sharply. "Something all about
machinery? And getting a contract for city paving
stones? Or publicly protesting the new football
rules? Goodness! Does it have to be a 'wise'
list? Does it have to be a worthy list? Something
that would really look commendable in a church
magazine? This was all your idea, you know!
You asked me, didn't you, to write out, just for fun,
the things I'd got to have before I'd be willing to
die?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," laughed the man. "Please
don't get stuffy about it. You surprised me so
about stroking the lion's face that I simply had to
chaff you a little. Truly, I care a great deal about
seeing that list. When you got off the train that
day it rattled me a confounded lot to see that your
camping togs were cut out of exactly the same piece
of cloth that mine were. Professor Ellis and his
wife and Doctor Andrews jollied me a good bit
about it in fact, but&mdash;hang it all&mdash;it's beginning
to dawn on me rather cozily, though I admit
still embarrassingly, that maybe your mind and
mine are cut out of the same piece of cloth, too.
Please let me see what you've written!"</p>

<p>With a grimace that was half reluctance, half defiance,
the young woman pulled the paper from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
pocket, smoothed it out on her knees for an instant
and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then," she said. "Help yourself
to the only authentic list of my 'Heart's Desires.'"
Then suddenly her whole face brightened
with amusement and she shook a sun-browned finger
threateningly at him. "Now remember," she
warned him, "I don't have to justify this list, no
matter how trivial it sounds, no matter how foolish
even; it is excuse enough for it&mdash;it is dignity
enough for it, that it happens to be so."</p>

<p>"Yes, surely," acknowledged the man.</p>

<p>Either consciously or unconsciously&mdash;then&mdash;he
took off his battered slouch hat and placed it softly
on the seat beside him. The act gave the very faintest
possible suggestion of reverence to the joke.
Then, rather slowly and hesitatingly, after the manner
of a man who is not specially accustomed to
reading aloud, he began:</p>

<p>"Things That I, Esther Davidson, Am Really
Obliged to Have Before I'm Willing to Die: No.
1. A solid summer of horseback riding on a rusty
brown pony among really scary mountains. No. 2.
A year's work at Oxford in Social Economics. No.
3. One single, solitary sunset view of the Bay of
Naples. No. 4. A very, very large oil-painting portrait
of a cloud&mdash;a great white, warm, cotton-batting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
looking, summer Sunday afternoon sort of
a cloud&mdash;I mean; the kind that you used to see as a
child when all 'chock full' of chicken and ice
cream and serene thoughts about Heaven, you lay
stretched out flat on the cool green grass and stared
right up into the face of God, and never even
guessed what made you blink so. No. 5. The ability
to buy one life-saving surgical operation for
some one who probably wouldn't otherwise have
afforded it. No. 6. A perfectly good dinner. No.
7. A completely happy Christmas. No. 8. A pink
sash. That's all."</p>

<p>With really terrifying gravity, the man put down
the finished page and lifted his searching eyes to the
woman's flushing, self-conscious face.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;a&mdash;pink&mdash;sash&mdash;exactly a&mdash;a&mdash;passion?"
he probed in much perplexity.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" nodded the young woman briskly.
"Oh, yes, indeed! It's an obsession in my life.
It's a groove in my brain. In the middle of the
night I wake and find myself sitting bolt upright in
bed saying it. The only time I ever took ether I
prattled persistently concerning it. When a Spring
sunshine is so marvelous that it makes me feel faint,
when the Vox Humana stop in a church-organ snarls
my heart-strings like an actual hand, when the great
galloping, tearing fire-engine horses come clanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
like mad around the street corner, it's the one
definite idea that explodes in my consciousness. It
began way back when I was a tiny six-year-old child
at a Maine woods 'camp meeting.' Did you ever
see a really primitive 'camp meeting'? All fir-balsam
trees and little rustic benches and pink calicoes
and Grand Army suits and high cheek-bones
and low insteps and&mdash;lots of noise? Rather inspiring
too, sometimes, or at least soul excitative.
It might do a good deal to any high-strung six-year-old
kiddie. Anyway, I saw the old village drunkard
jump up and wave his arms and wail ingenuously:
'I want to be a Christian!' And a palsied crone
beside me moaned and sobbed 'I want to be baptized!'
And even my timid, gentle mother leaped
impetuously to her feet and announced quite publicly
to every one 'I want to be washed in the
Blood of the Lamb!' And all about me I saw
frenzied neighbors and strangers dashing about making
these uncontrollable, confidential proclamations.
And suddenly, to my meager, indefinite baby-brain,
there rushed such an exultancy of positive personal
conviction that my poor little face must have been
literally transfigured with it, for my father lifted me
high to his tight-coated shoulders and cried out
ecstatically: 'A little child shall lead them! Hear!
Hear!' And with an emphasis on the personal pronoun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
which I hate to remember even at this remote
date, I screamed forth at the top of my lungs: 'I
want&mdash;a pink sash!'"</p>

<p>"And didn't you get it?" said Donas Guthrie.</p>

<p>The young woman crooked one eyebrow rather
comically. "N-o," she said, "I never got it!"</p>

<p>"But you could get it any time now," argued the
man.</p>

<p>Helplessly she threw out the palms of her hands
and the unexpected gesture displayed an amazing
slimness and whiteness of wrist.</p>

<p>"Stupid!" she laughed. "What would I do
with a pink sash now?" Ruthlessly her quick eyes
traveled down the full length of her scant, rough
skirt to the stubbed toes of her battered brown riding
boots. "Dust on the highway and chalk in the
classroom and 'grown-up-ness' everywhere!" she
persisted dully. "That's the real tragedy of growing
up&mdash;not that we outgrow our original desires,
but that retaining those desires, we outgrow the
ability to find satisfaction in them. People ought
to think of that, you know, when they thwart a
child's ten-cent passion for a tin trumpet. Fifty
years later, when that child is a bank president, it
may drive him almost crazy to have a toy-shop with
a whole window-full of tin trumpets come and cuddle
right next door to his bank&mdash;and nothing that
the man can do with them!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Like a little gray veil the tired look fell again
over her face. The man saw it and shuddered.</p>

<p>"Psychology is my subject at Varndon College,
you know," she continued listlessly, "and so I suppose
I'm rather specially interested in freakish
mental things. Anyway&mdash;pink sashes or Noah's
arks or enough sugar in your cocoa&mdash;I have a
theory that no child ever does outgrow its ungratified
legitimate desires; though subsequent maturity
may bring him to the point where his original desire
has reached such astounding proportions that the
original object can no longer possibly appease it."</p>

<p>Reminiscently, her narrowing eyes turned back
their inner vision to the far-away grotesque incident
of the camp meeting. "It isn't as though a child
asked for a thing the very first time that he thought
of it," she protested a trifle pathetically. "An idea
has been sown and has grown and germinated in his
mind a pretty long time before he gets up his courage
to speak to anybody about it. Oh, I tell you,
sir, the time to grant anybody a favor is the day the
favor is asked, for that day is the one psychological
moment of the world when supply and demand are
keyed exactly to each other's limits, and can be
mated beatifically to grow old, or die young, together.
But after that day&mdash;!</p>

<p>"Why, even with grown people," she added
hastily. "Did you ever know a marriage to turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
out to be specially successful where the man had
courted a reluctant woman for years and years before
she finally yielded to him? It's perfectly astonishing
how soon a wife like that is forced to
mourn: 'Why did he court me so long and so furiously
if he really cared as little as this? I'm just
exactly the same person that I was in the beginning!'&mdash;Yes,
that's precisely the trouble. In the
long time that she has kept her man waiting, she
has remained just exactly the same small object that
she was in the beginning, but the man's hunger for
her has materialized and spiritualized and idealized
a thousandfold beyond her paltry capacity to satisfy
it."</p>

<p>"That's a funny way to look at it," mused Donas
Guthrie.</p>

<p>"Is it?" said the young woman, a trifle petulantly.
"It doesn't seem funny to me!"</p>

<p>Then to Guthrie's infinite astonishment and embarrassment
the tears welled up suddenly into her
eyes and she turned her head abruptly away and began
to beat a nervous tattoo with one hand on the
flimsy piazza railing.</p>

<p>In the moment's awkward silence that ensued, the
little inn's clattery kitchen wafted up its pleasant,
odorous, noon-day suggestion of coffee and bacon.</p>

<p>"W-h-e-w!" gloated Guthrie desperately, "but
that smells good!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"It doesn't smell good to me," said the young
woman tartly.</p>

<p>With a definite thud the tilting leg of Guthrie's
chair came whacking down on the piazza floor.</p>

<p>"Why, you inconsistent little gourmand!" he exclaimed.
"Then why did you give 'one perfectly
good dinner' a place on your list of necessities?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," whispered the young woman,
a trifle tremulously. Then abruptly she burst out
laughing, and the face that she turned to Guthrie
again was all deliciously mussed up like a child's,
with tears and smiles and breeze-blown wisps of
hair.</p>

<p>"That dinner item was just another silly thing,"
she explained half bashfully, half defiantly. "It's
only that although I practically never eat much of
anything on ordinary occasions, whenever I get into
any kind of danger, whenever the train runs off the
track, or the steamer threatens to sink, or my car
gets stuck in the subway, I'm seized with the
most terrific gnawing hunger&mdash;as though&mdash;as
though&mdash;" Furiously the red flushed into her face
again. "Well&mdash;eternity sounds so l-long," she
stammered, "and I have a perfect horror, somehow&mdash;of
going to Heaven&mdash;on an empty stomach."</p>

<p>In mutual appreciation of a suddenly relaxed tension,
the man's laughter and the woman's rang out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
together throughout the dooryard and startled a
grazing pony into a whimpering whinny of sympathy.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd think my list was funny," protested
the young woman. "I knew perfectly well
that every single individual item on it would astonish
you."</p>

<p>Meditatively Donas Guthrie refilled his pipe and
evidently illuminated both the tobacco and the situation
with the same match.</p>

<p>"It isn't the things that are on your list that astonish
me," he remarked puffingly. "It's the
things that aren't on it that have given me the bit of
a jolt."</p>

<p>"Such as what?" frowned the young woman,
sliding jerkily out to the edge of her chair.</p>

<p>"Why, I'd always supposed that women were inherently
domestic," growled Guthrie. "I'd always
somehow supposed that Love and Home would figure
pretty largely on any woman's 'List of Necessities.'
But you! For Heaven's sake, haven't you
ever even thought of man in any specific relation to
your own life?"</p>

<p>"No, except in so far as he might retard my accomplishment
of the things on my list," she answered
frankly. Out of the gray film of pipe-smoke,
her small face loomed utterly serene, utterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
honest, utterly devoid of coquetry or self-consciousness.</p>

<p>"Any man would be apt to 'retard' your desire
to stroke a lion's face," said Guthrie grimly. "But
then," with a flicker of humor, "but then I see
you've omitted that item from your revised list.
Your only thought about man then," he continued
slowly, "is his probable tendency to interfere with
your getting the things out of life that you most
want."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is quite a novel idea to me," said Guthrie,
all a-smile again. "You mean then&mdash;if I
judge your premises correctly&mdash;you mean then
that if on the contrary you found a man who would
really facilitate the accomplishment of your 'heart's
desires,' you'd be willing to think a good deal about
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said the young woman.</p>

<p>"You mean then," persisted Guthrie, "you mean
then, just for the sake of the argument, that if I,
for instance, could guarantee for you every single
little item on this list, you'd be willing to marry
even me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Altogether unexpectedly Guthrie burst out laughing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly a little alarmed look quickened in the
young woman's sleepy eyes. "Does it seem cold-blooded
to you?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly 'cold' blooded, but certainly a
little cooler blooded than any man would have dared
to hope for," smiled Guthrie.</p>

<p>The frowning perplexity deepened in the young
woman's face. "You surely don't misunderstand
me?" she pleaded. "You don't think I'm mercenary
or anything horrid like that? Suppose I do
make a man's aptitude for gratifying my eight particular
whims the supreme test of his marital attractiveness
for me&mdash;it's not, you must understand,
by the sign of his material ability in the matter
that I should recognize the Man Who Was
Made for Me&mdash;but by the sign of his spiritual willingness."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;h!" said Guthrie very leisurely. Then,
with a trifle more vigor, he picked up the small list
again and scanned it carefully.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;wouldn't&mdash;be&mdash;such&mdash;a hard&mdash;list to&mdash;fulfil!"
he resumed presently. "'A summer
in the mountains?' You're having that now.
'Oxford?' 'Glimpse of Naples?' 'Cloud Picture?'
'Surgical Operation?' 'Pink Sash?'
'Good Dinner?' 'Christmas?' Why there's
really nothing here that I couldn't provide for you,
myself, if you'd only give me time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>With mischievous unconcern he smiled at the
young woman. With equally mischievous unconcern
the young woman smiled back at him.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary conversation we've had
this morning," she said. As though quite exhausted
by the uniqueness of it, she slid a little further down
into her seat and turned her cheek against the firm
support of the chair-back.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary understanding it has
brought us to!" exclaimed the man, scanning her
closely.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything particularly&mdash;understandy
about it," denied the young woman wearily.</p>

<p>It was then that Donas Guthrie asked his simple
question, boring his khaki-colored elbows into his
khaki-colored knees.</p>

<p>"Little Psychology Teacher," he said very gently,
"Little Psychology Teacher, Dr. Andrews says that
you've got typhoid fever. He's feared it now for
some time, and you know it's against his orders&mdash;your
being up to-day. So as long as I've proved
myself here and now, by your own test, the Man-Whom-You-Were-Looking-For,
I suggest that you
and I be&mdash;married this afternoon&mdash;before that
itinerant shiny-shouldered preacher out in the corral
escapes us altogether&mdash;and then we'll send the rest
of the party on about their business, and you and
Dr. Andrews and Hanlon's Mary and I will camp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
right down here where we are&mdash;and scrap the old
typhoid fever to its finish. Will you, Little Psychology
Teacher?"</p>

<p>Lifting her white hands to her throbbing temples
the young woman turned her astonished face jerkily
toward him.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;did&mdash;you&mdash;say?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"I said: 'Will you marry me this afternoon?'"
repeated Guthrie.</p>

<p>Bruskly she pushed that part of the phrase
aside. "What did you really say?" she insisted.
"What did Dr. Andrews say?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Andrews says that you've got typhoid
fever," repeated Guthrie.</p>

<p>Inertly she blinked her big brown eyes for an instant.
Then suddenly her hands went groping out
to the arms of her chair. Her face was horror-stricken.
"Why didn't he tell me, himself?"</p>

<p>"Because I asked him to let me tell you," said
Guthrie quietly.</p>

<p>"When did he tell you?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"Just before I came up on the piazza," said Guthrie.</p>

<p>"How did he tell you?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"How did he tell me?" mused Guthrie wretchedly.
After all, underneath his occasional whimsicality
he was distinctly literal-minded. "How
did he tell me? Why I saw them all powwowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
together in the corral, and Andrews looked up sort
of queer and said: 'Say, Guthrie, that little Psychology
friend of yours has got typhoid fever.
What in thunder are we going to do?"</p>

<p>The strained lines around Esther Davidson's
mouth relaxed for a second.</p>

<p>"Well, what in thunder am I going to do?" she
joked heroically. But the effort at flippancy was
evidently quite too much for her. In another instant
her head pitched forward against the piazza
railing and her voice, when she spoke again, was
almost indistinguishable.</p>

<p>"And you knew all this an hour ago!" she accused
him incoherently. "Knew my predicament&mdash;knew
my inevitable weakness and fear and mortification&mdash;knew
me a stranger among strangers.
And yet you came up here to jolly me inconsequently&mdash;about
a million foolish things!"</p>

<p>"It was because at the end of the hour I hoped
to be something to you that would quite prevent
your feeling a 'stranger among strangers,'" said
Guthrie very quietly. "I have asked you to marry
me this afternoon, you must remember."</p>

<p>The young woman's lip curled tremulously.
"You astonish me!" she scoffed. "I had always
understood that men did not marry very easily.
Quick to love, slow to marry, is supposed to be
your most striking characteristic&mdash;and here are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
you asking marriage of me, and you haven't even
loved me yet!"</p>

<p>"You women do not seem to marry any too
easily," smiled Guthrie gazing nervously from his
open watch to the furthest corner of the corral,
where the preacher's raw-boned pony, nose in air,
was stubbornly refusing to take his bit.</p>

<p>"Indeed we do marry&mdash;perfectly easily&mdash;when
we once love," retorted the woman contentiously!
"It's the love part of it that we are reluctant
about!"</p>

<p>"But I haven't asked you to love me," protested
the man with much patience. "I merely asked you
to marry me."</p>

<p>The woman's jaw dropped. "Out of sympathy
for my emergency, out of mistaken chivalry, you're
asking me to marry you, and not even pretending
that you love me?" she asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to love you yet. I've only
known you such a little while," said the man quite
simply. Almost sternly he rose and began to pace
up and down the narrow confines of the little piazza.
"All I know is," he asserted, "that the very first
moment you stepped off the train at Laramie, I
knew you were the woman whom I was&mdash;going to
love&mdash;sometime."</p>

<p>Very softly he slid back into the rustic seat he
had just vacated, and taking the woman's small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
clenched hands in his began to smooth out her fingers
like poor crumpled ribbons.</p>

<p>"Now, Little Psychology Teacher," he said, "I
want you to listen very, very carefully to everything
I say. Do you like me all right?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;e&mdash;s."</p>

<p>"Better than you like Andrews or Ellis or even
the old Judge?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"Ever since we all started out together on the
Trail you've just sort of naturally fallen to my lot,
haven't you? Whenever you needed your pony's
girth tightened, or whenever you wanted a drink
of water, or whenever the big canyons scared you,
or whenever the camp fire smoked you, you've just
sort of naturally turned to me, haven't you? And
it would be fair enough, wouldn't it, to say that at
least I've never made any situation worse for you?
So that if anything ugly or awkward were going
to happen&mdash;perhaps you really would rather have
me around than any one else?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;surely."</p>

<p>"Maybe even, when we've been watching Ellis
and his Missis riding ahead, all hand in hand and
smile in smile, you've wondered a bit, woman-like,
how it would seem, for instance, to be riding along
hand in hand and smile in smile with me?"</p>

<p>"P-o-s-s-i-b-l-y."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never had any special curiosity about how it
would seem to go hand and hand with&mdash;Andrews?"</p>

<p>"Foolish!"</p>

<p>"Hooray!" cried Guthrie. "That's all that I
really needed to know! Oh, don't feel bashful about
it. It surely is an absolutely impersonal compliment
on your part. It isn't even you that I'm
under obligations to for the kindness, but Nature
with a great big capital 'N.' Somehow I always
have had an idea that you women instinctively do
divide all mankind into three classes: first, Those
Whom You Couldn't Possibly Love; second,
Those Whom You Could Possibly Love, and third,
the One Man of the World Whom You Actually
Do Love. And unless this mysterious Nature with
a capital 'N' has already qualified a man for the
second class, God himself can't promote that man
into the third class. So it seems to me that every
fellow could save himself an awful lot of misunderstanding
and wasted time if he'd do just what I've
done&mdash;make a distinctly preliminary proposal to
his lady; not 'Do you love me?' which might take
her fifteen years to decide, but: 'Could you love
me?' which any woman can tell the first time she
sees you. And if she can't possibly love you, that
settles everything neatly then and there, but if she
can possibly, why, with Nature once on his side, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
man's a craven who can't put up a mighty good
scrap for his coveted prize. Doesn't this all make
sense to you?"</p>

<p>Cannily the young woman lifted her eyes to his
and fathomed him mutely for an instant. Then:</p>

<p>"Perfectly good 'sense' but no feeling," she answered
dully.</p>

<p>"It's only 'sense' that I'm trying to make," acknowledged
Guthrie. "Now look here, you Little
Teacher Person, I'm going to talk to you just as
bluntly as I would to another fellow. You are in
a hole&mdash;the deuce of a hole! You have got typhoid
fever, and it may run ten days and it may
run ten weeks! And you are two thousand miles
from home&mdash;among strangers! And no matter
how glad I personally may be that you did push on
and join us, sick or well, from every practical standpoint,
of course, it surely was heedless and ill-considered
of you to start off in poor health on a trip
like this and run the risk of forcing perfectly unconcerned
strangers to pay for it all. Personally,
you seem so much to belong to me already that it
gives me goose-flesh to think of your having to put
yourself under obligations to any purely conscientious
person. Mrs. Ellis, of course, will insist, out of common
humanity, upon giving up her trip and staying
behind with you, but Mrs. Ellis, Little Teacher, is
on her honeymoon, and Ellis couldn't stay behind&mdash;it's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
his party&mdash;he'd have to go on with his
people&mdash;and you'd never be able to compensate
anybody for a broken honeymoon, and the Judge's
youngster couldn't nurse a sick kitten, and the
two women teachers from New York have been
planning seven years for this trip, they told me,
and we couldn't decently take it away from them.
But you and I, Little Psychology Lady, are not
strangers to each other. Hanlon's Mary here at
the ranch house, rough as she is, has at least the
serving hands of a woman, and Andrews belongs
naturally to the tribe which is consecrated to inconveniences,
and both can be compensated accordingly.
And I would have married you, anyway,
before another year was out! Yes, I would!"</p>

<p>Apparently ignoring everything that he had said,
she turned her face scowlingly toward the sound of
hammering that issued suddenly through the piazza
door.</p>

<p>"Oh, Glory!" she complained. "Are they making
my coffin already?"</p>

<p>With a little laugh, Guthrie relinquished her limp
fingers, and jumping up, took another swift turn
along the piazza, stopping only to bang the door
shut again. When he faced her once more the
twinkle was all gone from his eyes.</p>

<p>"You're quite right, what you said about men,"
he resumed with desperate seriousness. "We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a heap sight quicker in our susceptibilities than in
our mentalities! Therefore, no sane man ever does
marry till his brain has caught up with his emotions!
But sometimes, you know, something happens
that hustles a man's brain along a bit, and this
time my brain seems fairly to have jumped to its
destination and clean-beaten even the emotions in
the race. In cool, positive judgment I tell you I
want to marry you this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You've confessed yourself, haven't you, that
you've no severer ideal for marriage than that a
man should be generous enough to give your personality,
no matter how capricious, a chance to
breathe? Haven't I qualified sufficiently as that
amiable man? More than that, I'm free to love
you; I'm certainly keen to serve you; I'm reasonably
well able to provide for you, and you naturally
have a right to know that I've led a decent life.
It's ten good years now since I was thirty and
first found nerve enough to break away from the
stifling business life I hated and get out into the
open, where there's surely less money but infinitely
more air. And in ten years I've certainly found
considerable chance to fulfil a few of the items in
my own little 'List of Necessities.' I've seen Asia
and I've seen Africa, and I've written the book
I've always wanted to write on North American
mountain structures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"But there's a lot more that I crave to do.
Maybe I've got a bit of a 'capricious personality'
myself! Maybe I also have been hunting for the
mate who would give my personality a chance to
breathe. Certainly I've never wanted any home
yet, except when the right time came, the arms of
the right woman. And I guess you must be she,
because you're the first woman I've ever seen whom
I'd trust to help me just as hard to play my chosen
games as I'd help her to play hers! I tell you&mdash;I
want&mdash;very much&mdash;to marry you this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Why do you dally with me so? Isn't it your
own argument that there's only just one day in the
love-life of a man and woman when the question
and the answer mate exactly, and the books are balanced
perfectly even for the new start together?
Demand and supply, debit and credit, hunger and
food? You, wild for help, and I wild to help you!
What difference does it make what you call it?
Isn't this our day?"</p>

<p>"For a man who's usually as silent as you are,
don't you think you're talking a good deal, considering
how sick you said I was?" asked the young
woman, not unmirthfully.</p>

<p>Guthrie's square jaws snapped together like a
trap. "I was merely trying to detain you," he
mumbled, "until Hanlon had finished knocking the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
windows out of your room. We're going to give
you all the air you can breathe, anyway."</p>

<p>A little sullenly he started for the stairs. Then
just at the door he turned unexpectedly and his face
was all smiles again.</p>

<p>"Little Psychology Teacher," he said, "I have
made you a formal, definite offer of marriage. And
in just about ten minutes from now I am coming
back for my answer."</p>

<p>When he did return a trifle sooner than he had
intended, he met her in the narrow upper hallway,
with hands outstretched, groping her way unsteadily
toward her room. As though her equilibrium was
altogether disturbed by his sudden advent, she reeled
back against the wall.</p>

<p>"Mr. Donas Guthrie," she said, "I'm feeling
pretty wobbly! Mr. Donas Guthrie," she said, "I
guess I'm pretty sick."</p>

<p>"It's a cruel long way down the hall," suggested
Guthrie. "Wouldn't you like me to carry
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I&mdash;would," sighed the Little Psychology
Teacher.</p>

<p>Even to Guthrie's apprehensive mind, her weight
proved most astonishingly light. The small head
drooping limply back from the slender neck seemed
actually the only heavy thing about her, yet there
were apparently only two ideas in that head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid of Hanlon's Mary, and I don't like
Dr. Andrews&mdash;very&mdash;specially&mdash;much," she kept
repeating aimlessly. Then halfway to her room
her body stiffened suddenly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Donas Guthrie," she asked. "Do you
think I'm probably going to die?"</p>

<p>"N-a-w!" said Guthrie, his nose fairly crinkling
with positiveness.</p>

<p>"But they don't give you much of anything to
eat in typhoid, do they?" she persisted hectically.</p>

<p>"I suppose not," acknowledged Guthrie.</p>

<p>With disconcerting unexpectedness she began to
cry&mdash;a soft, low, whimpery cry like a sleepy
child's.</p>

<p>"If any day should come when&mdash;they think&mdash;that
I am going to die," she moaned, "who will
there be to see that I do get&mdash;something awfully
good to eat?"</p>

<p>"I'll see to it," said Guthrie, "if you'll only put
me in authority."</p>

<p>As though altogether indifferent to anything that
he might say, her tension relaxed again and without
further parleying she let Guthrie carry her
across the threshold of her room and set her down
cautiously in the creaky rocking chair. The eyes
that lifted to his were as vague and turbid as brown
velvet.</p>

<p>"There's one good thing about typhoid," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
moaned. "It doesn't seem to hurt any, does it?
In fact, I think I rather like it. It feels as warm
and snug and don't-care as a hot lemonade at bed
time. But what?" brightening suddenly, "but what
was it you asked me to think about? I feel sort of
confused&mdash;but it was something, I remember, that
I was going to argue with you about."</p>

<p>"It was what I said about marrying me,"
prompted Guthrie.</p>

<p>"Oh, y-e-s," smiled the Little Psychology Teacher.
Hazily for a moment she continued staring at him
with her fingers prodded deep into her temples.
Then suddenly, like a flower blasted with heat, she
wilted down into her chair, groping blindly out with
one hand toward the sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p>"Whatever you think best to do about it," she
faltered, "I guess you'd better arrange pretty
quickly&mdash;'cause I think&mdash;I'm&mdash;going&mdash;out."</p>

<p>This is how it happened that Mr. and Mrs. Donas
Guthrie and Dr. Andrews stayed behind at the
ranch house with Hanlon and Hanlon's Mary, and
a piebald pony or two, and a herd of Angora goats,
and a pink geranium plant, and the strange intermittent
smell of a New England farmhouse which
lurked in Hanlon's goods and chattels even after
thirty years, and three or four stale, tattered magazines&mdash;and
typhoid fever.</p>

<p>It was typhoid fever that proved essentially the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
most incalculable companion of them all. Hanlon's
austerity certainly never varied from day to day,
nor the inherent sullenness of Hanlon's Mary.</p>

<p>The meager sick-room, stripped to its bare pine
skin of every tawdry colored print and fluttering
cheese-cloth curtain, faced bluntly toward the west&mdash;a
vital little laboratory in which the unknown
quantity of a woman's endurance and the fallible
skill of one man, the stubborn bravery of another,
and the quite inestimable will of God were to be
fused together in a desperate experiment to precipitate
Life rather than Death.</p>

<p>So October waxed into November, and so waxed
misgiving into apprehension, and apprehension into
actual fear. In any more cheerful situation it
would have been at least interesting to have watched
the infuriated expletives issue from Andrew's
perennially smiling lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang not having anything to work with!"
he kept reiterating and reiterating. "Hang being
shut off like this on a ranch where there aren't anything
but sheep and goats and one old stingy cow
that Hanlon's Mary guards with her life 'cause the
lady's only a school teacher, but a baby is a baby.'
Hang Hanlon's Mary! And hang not being altogether
able to blame her! And hang not knowing,
anyway, just what nanny-goat's milk would do for
a typhoid patient! And hang&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>But before the expletives, and through the expletives,
and after the expletives, Andrews was all
hero, working, watching, experimenting, retrenching,
humanly comprehensive, more than humanly
vigilant.</p>

<p>So, with the brain of a doctor and the heart of
a lover, the two men worked and watched and
waited through the tortuous autumn days and nights,
blind to the young dawn stealing out like a luminous
mist from the night-smothered mountains; deaf to
the flutter of sun-dried leaves in the radiant noon-time;
dull to the fruit-scented fragrance of the early
twilight, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, sensing
nothing, except the flicker of a pulse or the rise of
a temperature.</p>

<p>And then at last there came a harsh, wintry feeling
day, when Andrews, stepping out into the
hall, called Guthrie softly to him and said, still
smiling:</p>

<p>"Guthrie, old man, I don't think we're going to
win this game!"</p>

<p>"W-h-a-t?" gasped Guthrie.</p>

<p>With his mouth still curling amiably around his
words, Andrews repeated the phrase. "I said, I
don't think we're going to win this game. No,
nothing new's happened. She's simply burning
out. Can't you understand? I mean she's probably&mdash;going
to die!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of the jumble of words that hurtled through
Guthrie's mind only four slipped his lips.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;she's&mdash;my&mdash;wife!" he protested.</p>

<p>"Other men's wives have died before this," said
Andrews still smiling.</p>

<p>"Man," cried Guthrie, "if you smile again, I'll
break your head!"</p>

<p>With his tears running down like rain into the
broadening trough of his smile, Andrews kept right
on smiling. "You needn't be so cross about it,"
he said. "You're not the only one who likes her!
I wanted her myself! You're nothing but a tramp
on the face of the earth&mdash;and I could have given
her the snuggest home in Yonkers!"</p>

<p>With their arms across each other's shoulders they
went back into the sick room.</p>

<p>Rousing from her lethargy, the young woman
opened her eyes upon them with the first understanding
that she had shown for some days.
Inquisitively she stared from Guthrie's somber eyes
to Andrews' distorted cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Taking instant advantage of her unwonted rationality,
Andrews blurted out the question that
was uppermost in his professional responsibility.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, maybe, your people ought to
know about your being sick?" he said. "Now, if
you could give us any addresses."</p>

<p>For a second it really seemed as though the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
would merely safely ignite her common
sense.</p>

<p>"Why yes, of course," she acquiesced. "My
brother."</p>

<p>Then suddenly, without any warning, her most
dangerous imagination caught fire.</p>

<p>"You mean," she faltered, "that&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;not&mdash;going
to get well?"</p>

<p>Before either man was quick enough to contradict
her, the shock had done its work. Piteously
she turned her face to the pillow.</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;never&mdash;to&mdash;go&mdash;to&mdash;Oxford?"
she whispered in mournful astonishment. "Never&mdash;even&mdash;to&mdash;see
my&mdash;Bay of Naples?&mdash;Never
to&mdash;have a&mdash;a&mdash;perfectly happy Christmas?"
A little petulantly then her brain began to
clog. "I think I&mdash;might at least have had&mdash;the
pink sash!" she complained. Then, equally suddenly
her strength rallied for an instant and the
eyes that she lifted to Guthrie's were filled with a
desperate effort at raillery. "Bring on your&mdash;anchovies
and caviar," she reminded him, "and the
stuffed green peppers&mdash;and remember I don't like
my fillet too well done&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Five minutes later in the hallway Andrews
caught Guthrie just as he was chasing downstairs
after Hanlon.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he asked curiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to send Hanlon out to the telegraph
station," said Guthrie. "I'm going to wire to
Denver for a pink sash!"</p>

<p>"What she was raving about?" quizzed Andrews.
"Are you raving too?"</p>

<p>"It's the only blamed thing in the whole world
that she's asked for that I can get her," said Guthrie.</p>

<p>"It'll take five days," growled Andrews.</p>

<p>"I know it!"</p>

<p>"It won't do her any good."</p>

<p>"I can't help that!"</p>

<p>"She'll&mdash;be gone before it gets here."</p>

<p>"You can't help that!"</p>

<p>But she wasn't "gone," at all before it came.
All her vitalities charred, to be sure, like a fire-swept
woodland, but still tenacious of life, still
fighting for reorganization, a little less feverish, a
little stronger-pulsed, she opened her eyes in a puzzled,
sad sort of little smile when Guthrie shook
the great, broad, shimmering gauze-like ribbon
ticklingly down across her wasted hands, and then
apparently drowsed off to sleep again. But when
both men came back to the room a few moments
later, almost half the pink sash was cuddled under
her cheek. And Hanlon's Mary came and peered
through the doorway, with the whining baby still
in her arms, and reaching out and fretting a piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of pink fringe between her hardy fingers, sniffed
mightily.</p>

<p>"And you sent my man all the way to the wire,"
she asked, "and grubbed him three whole days
waitin' round, just for that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sure," said Guthrie.</p>

<p>"G-a-w-d!" said Hanlon's Mary.</p>

<p>And, the next week the patient was even better,
and the next week, better still. Then, one morning
after days and days of seemingly interminable
silence and stupor, she opened her eyes perfectly
wide and asked Guthrie abruptly:</p>

<p>"Whom did I marry? You or Dr. Andrews?"</p>

<p>And Guthrie in a sudden perversity of shock and
embarrassment lied grimly:</p>

<p>"Dr. Andrews!"</p>

<p>"I didn't either!&mdash;it was you!" came the immediate,
not too strong, but distinctly temperish
response.</p>

<p>Something in the new vitality of the tone made
Guthrie stop whatever he was doing and eye her
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"How long have you been conscious like this?"
he queried in surprise.</p>

<p>The faintest perceptible flicker of mischief
crossed her haggard face.</p>

<p>"Three&mdash;days," she acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;?" began Guthrie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I&mdash;didn't know&mdash;just what to call
you," she faltered.</p>

<p>After that no power on earth apparently could
induce any further speech from her for another
three days. Solemn and big-eyed and totally unfathomable,
she lay watching Guthrie's every gesture,
every movement. From the door to the chair,
from the chair to the window, from the window
back to the chair, she lay estimating him altogether
disconcertingly. Across the hand that steadied her
drinking glass, she studied the poise of his lean, firm
wrist. Out from the shadow-mystery of her heavy
lashes, she questioned the ultimate value of each
frown or smile.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly&mdash;just as abruptly as the first
time she had spoken:</p>

<p>"What day is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It's Christmas," said Guthrie softly.</p>

<p>"O-h!&mdash;O-h!&mdash;O-h!" she exclaimed, very
slowly. Then with increasing interest and wonder,
"Is there snow on the ground?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"No," said Guthrie.</p>

<p>"Is it full moon to-night?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"No," said Guthrie.</p>

<p>"Is there any small, freckle-faced, alto-voiced
choir boy in the house, trotting around humming
funny little tail-ends of anthems and carols, while
he's buckling up his skates?" she stammered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Guthrie.</p>

<p>"Are there any old, white-haired loving people
cuddled in the chimney corner?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"No," said Guthrie.</p>

<p>"Isn't there&mdash;any Christmas tree?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Aren't there even any presents?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she smiled. "Isn't it funny!"</p>

<p>"What's funny?" asked Guthrie perplexedly.</p>

<p>The eyes that lifted to his were brimming full of
a strange, wistful sort of astonishment. "Why,
it's funny," she faltered, "it's funny&mdash;that without&mdash;any
of these things&mdash;that I thought were so
necessary to it&mdash;I've found my 'perfectly happy
Christmas.'"</p>

<p>Then, almost bashfully, her wisp-like fingers
went straying out toward the soft silken folds of
the precious pink sash which she kept always close
to her pillow.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;you&mdash;don't&mdash;mind," she said, "I
think I'll cut my sash in two and give half of it
to Hanlon's Mary to make a dress for her baby."</p>

<p>The medicine spoon dropped rather clatteringly
out of Guthrie's hand.</p>

<p>"But I sent all the way to Denver for it," he
protested.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know all about that," she acknowledged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
"But&mdash;what&mdash;can&mdash;a great big girl&mdash;like
me&mdash;do with a&mdash;pink sash?"</p>

<p>"But you said you wanted it!" cried Guthrie.
"Why, it took a man and a pony and a telegraph
station five entire days to get it, and they had to
flag the express train specially for it&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A little wearily she closed her eyes and then
opened them again blinkingly.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty tired, now," she said, "so I don't
want to talk about it&mdash;but don't you&mdash;understand?
I've revised my whole list of necessities.
Out of the wide&mdash;wide&mdash;world&mdash;I find that I
don't really want anything&mdash;except&mdash;just&mdash;you!"</p>

<h2>WOMAN'S ONLY BUSINESS</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="162" height="164" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE men at the club were horridly
busy that night discussing the
silly English law about marrying
your dead wife's sister. The talk
was quite rabid enough even before
an English High-churchman
infused his pious venom into the subject-matter.
When the argument was at its highest and the
drinks were at their lowest, Bertus Sagner, the
biology man at the university, jumped up from his
seat with blazing eyes and said "<span class="smcap">rats!</span>"&mdash;not anything
long and Latin, not anything obscure and
evasive, not even "rodents," but just plain
"<span class="smcap">rats!</span>" The look on his face was inordinately
disgusted, or indeed more than disgusted, unless
disgust is perhaps an emotion that may at times
be served red-hot. As he broke away from the
gabbling crowd and began to hunt noisily round
the room for his papers, I gathered up my own
chemistry notebook and started after him. I was a
new man in town and a comparative stranger. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Sagner and I had been chums once long ago in
Berlin.</div>

<p>At the outside door he turned now and eyed me
a bit shamefacedly. "Barney, old man," he said,
"are you going my way? Well, come along."
The broad-shouldered breadth of the two of us
blocked out the light from the shining chandelier
and sent our clumsy feet fairly stumbling down the
harsh granite steps. The jarring lurch exploded
Sagner's irritation into a short, sharp, damny growl,
and I saw at once that his nerves were raw like a
woman's.</p>

<p>As we turned into the deep-shadowed, spooky-black
college roadway, the dormitories' yellow
lights and laughter flared forth grotesquely like the
Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge cut up for a Jack-o'-Lantern.
At the edge of the Lombardy poplars
I heard Sagner swallowing a little bit overhard.</p>

<p>"I suspect that I made rather a fool of myself
back there," he confided abruptly, "but if there's
anything under the day or night sky that makes me
mad, it's the idiotic babble, babble, babble, these
past few weeks about the 'dead wife's sister' law."</p>

<p>"What's your grouch?" I asked. "You're
not even a married man, let alone a widower."</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly with a spurting match and
a big cigar and lighted up unconsciously all the extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
frowning furrows of his face. The
match went out and he struck another, and that
match went out and he struck another&mdash;and another,
and all the time it seemed to me as though
just the flame in his face was hot enough to kindle
any ordinary cigar. After each fruitless, breeze-snuffed
effort he snapped his words out like so
many tiny, tempery torpedoes. "Of&mdash;all&mdash;the&mdash;rot!"
he ejaculated. "Of&mdash;all&mdash;the nonsense!"
he puffed and mumbled. "A&mdash;whole&mdash;great,
grown-up empire fussing and brawling about
a 'dead wife's sister.' A dead wife! What does
a dead wife care who marries her sister? Great
heavens! If they really want to make a good moral
law that will help somebody, why&mdash;don't&mdash;they&mdash;make&mdash;a&mdash;law&mdash;that
will forbid a man's
flirting with his living wife's sister?"</p>

<p>When I laughed I thought he would strike me,
but after a husky second he laughed, too, through
a great blue puff of smoke and a blaze like the
headlight of an engine. In another instant he had
vaulted the low fence and was starting off across
lots for his own rooms, but before I could catch
up with him he whirled abruptly in his tracks and
came back to me.</p>

<p>"Will you come over to the Lennarts' with me
for a moment?" he asked. "I was there at dinner
with them to-night and I left my spectacles."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Very willingly I acquiesced, and we plunged off
single file into the particular darkness that led to
Professor Lennart's rose-garden. Somewhere remotely
in my mind hummed and halted a vague,
evasive bit of man-gossip about Lennart's amazingly
pretty sister-in-law. Yet Sagner did not look
exactly to me like a man who was going courting.
Even in that murky darkness I could visualize perfectly
from Sagner's pose and gait the same strange,
bleak, facial furnishings that had attracted me so
astoundingly in Berlin&mdash;the lean, flat cheeks
cleaned close as the floor of a laboratory; the ugly,
short-cropped hair; the mouth, just for work; the
nose, just for work; the ears, just for work&mdash;not
a single, decorative, pleasant thing from crown to
chin except those great, dark, gorgeous, miraculously
virgin eyes, with the huge, shaggy eyebrows
lowering down prudishly over them like two common
doormats on which every incoming vision must
first stop and wipe its feet. Once in a caf&eacute; in
Berlin I saw a woman try to get into Sagner's
eyes&mdash;without stopping. Right in the middle of
our dinner I jumped as though I had been shot.
"Why, what was <i>that?</i>" I cried. "What was
<i>that?</i>"</p>

<p>"What was what?" drawled Sagner. Try as
I might the tiniest flicker of a grin tickled my lips.
"Oh, nothing," I mumbled apologetically. "I just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
thought I heard a door slam-bang in a woman's
face."</p>

<p>"What door?" said Sagner stupidly. "What
woman?"</p>

<p>Old Sagner was deliciously stupid over many
things, but he dissected the darkness toward Professor
Lennart's house as though it had been his
favorite kind of cadaver. Here, was the hardening
turf, compact as flesh. There, was the tough, tight
tendon of the ripping ground pine. Farther along
under an exploring match a great vapid peony
loomed like a dead heart. Somewhere out in an
orchard the May-blooms smelled altogether too
white. Almost at the edge of the Lennarts' piazza
he turned and stepped back to my pace and began
talking messily about some stale biological specimen
that had just arrived from the Azores.</p>

<p>College people, it seemed, did not ring bells for
one another, and the most casual flop of Sagner's
knuckles against the door brought Mrs. Lennart almost
immediately to welcome us. "Almost immediately,"
I say, because the slight, faltering delay in
her footfall made me wonder even then whether it
was limb or life that had gone just a little bit lame.
But the instant the hall light struck her face my
hand clutched down involuntarily on Sagner's
shoulder. It was the same, same face whose
brighter, keener, shinier pastelled likeness had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the only joyous object in Sagner's homesick German
room. With almost embarrassing slowness
now we followed her lagging steps back to the
library.</p>

<p>It was the first American home that I had seen
for some years, and the warmth of it, and the
color, and the glow, and the luxurious, deep-seated
comfort, mothered me like the notes of an old, old
song. Between the hill-green walls the long room
stretched like a peaceful valley to the very edge of
the huge, gray field-stone fireplace that blocked the
final vista like a furious breastwork raised against
all the invading tribes of history. Red books and
gold frames and a chocolate-colored bronze or two
caught up the flickering glint from the apple-wood
fire, and out of some shadowy corner flanked by
a grand piano a young girl's contralto voice,
sensuous as liquid plush, was lipping its magic way
up and down the whole wonderful, molten scale.</p>

<p>The corner was rather small, but out of it loomed
instantly the tall, supple figure of Professor Lennart
with his thousand-year-old brown eyes and his
young gray hair. We were all big fellows, but
Lennart towered easily three inches over anybody
else's head. Professionally, too, he had outstripped
the rest of us. People came gadding from
all over the country to consult his historical criticisms
and interpretations. And I hardly know how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
to express the man's vivid, luminous, incandescent
personality. Surely no mother in a thousand would
have chosen to have her son look like me, and I
hope that no mother in a million would really have
yearned to have a boy look like Sagner, but any
mother, I think, would gladly have compromised
on Lennart. I suppose he was handsome. Rising
now, as he did, from the murkiest sort of a shadow,
the mental and physical radiance of him made me
want to laugh right out loud just for sheer pleasure.</p>

<p>Following closely behind his towering bulk, the
girl with the contralto voice stepped out into the
lamplight, and I made my most solemn and profound
German bow over her proffered hand before
the flaming mischief in her finger tips sent my eyes
staring up into her astonishing face.</p>

<p>I have never thought that American women are
extraordinarily beautiful, but rather that they wear
their beauty like a thinnish sort of veil across the
adorable, insistent expressiveness of their features.
But this girl's face was so thick with beauty that
you could not tell in one glance, or even two glances,
or perhaps three, whether she had any expression
at all. Kindness or meanness, brightness or dullness,
pluck or timidity, were absolutely undecipherable
in that physically perfect countenance.
She was very small, and very dark, and very active,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
with hair like the color of eight o'clock&mdash;daylight
and darkness and lamplight all snarled up together&mdash;and
lips all crude scarlet, and eyes as absurdly
big and round as a child's good-by kiss. Yet never
for one instant could you have called her anything
so impassive as "attractive." "Attracting" is the
only hasty, ready-made word that could possibly fit
her. Personally I do not like the type. The prettiest
picture postal that ever was printed could not
lure me across the borders of any unknown country.
When I travel even into Friendship Land I
want a good, clear face-map to guide my explorations.</p>

<p>There was a boy, too, in the room&mdash;the Lennarts'
son&mdash;a brown-faced lad of thirteen whose
algebraic s&eacute;ance with his beloved mother we had
most brutally interrupted.</p>

<p>Professor Lennart's fad, as I have said, was history.
Mrs. Lennart's fad was presumably housekeeping.
The sister-in-law's fad was unmistakably
men. Like an electric signboard her fascinating,
spectacular sex-vanity flamed and flared from her
coyly drooped eyes to her showy little feet. Every
individual gesture signaled distinctly, "I am an
extraordinarily beautiful little woman." Now it
was her caressing hand on Lennart's shoulder; now
it was her maddening, dazzling smile hurled like a
bombshell into Sagner's perfectly prosy remark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
about the weather, now it was her teasing lips
against the boy's tousled hair; now it was her tip-toeing,
swaying, sweet-breathed exploration of a
cobweb that the linden trees had left across my
shoulder.</p>

<p>Lennart was evidently utterly subjugated. Like
a bright moth and a very dull flame the girl chased
him unceasingly from one chair, or one word, or
one laugh to another. A dozen times their hands
touched, or their smiles met, or their thoughts mated
in distinctly personal if not secret understanding.
Once when Mrs. Lennart stopped suddenly in the
midst of my best story and asked me to repeat what
I had been saying, I glanced up covertly and saw
the girl kissing the tip of her finger a little bit over-mockingly
to her brother-in-law. Never in any
country but America could such a whole scene have
been enacted in absolute moral innocence. It made
me half ashamed and half very proud of my country.
In continental Europe even the most trivial,
innocent audacity assumes at once such utterly preposterous
proportions of evil. But here before my
very eyes was the most dangerous man-and-woman
game in the world being played as frankly and ingenuously
and transiently as though it had been
croquet.</p>

<p>Through it all, Sagner, frowning like ten devils,
sat at the desk with his chin in his hands, staring&mdash;staring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
at the girl. I suppose that she thought he
was fascinated. He was. He was fairly yearning
to vivisect her. I had seen that expression before
in his face&mdash;reverence, repulsion, attraction, distaste,
indomitable purpose, blood-curdling curiosity&mdash;<span class="smcap">science</span>.</p>

<p>When I dragged him out of the room and down
the steps half an hour later my sides were cramped
with laughter. "If we'd stayed ten minutes
longer," I chuckled, "she would have called you
'Bertie' and me 'Boy.'"</p>

<p>But Sagner would not laugh.</p>

<p>"She's a pretty girl all right," I ventured again.</p>

<p>"Pretty as h&mdash;," whispered Sagner.</p>

<p>As we rounded the corner of the house the long
French window blazed forth on us. Clear and
bright in the lamplight stood Lennart with his right
arm cuddling the girl to his side. "Little sister,"
he was saying, "let's go back to the piano and have
some more music." Smiling her kindly good night
we saw Mrs. Lennart gather up her books and start
off limpingly across the hall, with the devoted boy
following close behind her.</p>

<p>"Then she's really lame?" I asked Sagner as
we swung into the noisy gravel path.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said; "she got hurt in a runaway
accident four years ago. Lennart doesn't know
how to drive a <i>goat!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>"Seems sort of too bad," I mused dully.</p>

<p>Then Sagner laughed most astonishingly. "Yes,
sort of too bad," he mocked me.</p>

<p>It was almost ten o'clock when we circled back
to the college library. Only a few grinds were
there buzzing like June-bugs round the low-swinging
green lamps. Even the librarian was missing.
But Madge Hubert, the librarian's daughter, was
keeping office hours in his stead behind a sumptuous
old mahogany desk. At the very first college party
that I had attended, Madge Hubert had been pointed
out to me with a certain distinction as being the
girl that Bertus Sagner was <i>almost</i> in love with.
Then, as now, I was startled by the surprising
youthfulness of her. Surely she was not more than
three years ahead of the young girl whom we had
left at Professor Lennart's house. With unmistakable
friendly gladness she welcomed Sagner to
the seat nearest her, and accorded me quite as much
chair and quite as much smile as any new man in
a university town really deserved. In another moment
she had closed her book, pushed a full box of
matches across the table to us, and switched off the
electric light that fairly threatened to scorch her
straight blond hair.</p>

<p>One by one the grinds looked up and nodded and
smiled, and puckered their vision toward the clock,
and "folded their tents like the Arabs and silently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
stole away," leaving us two men there all alone with
the great silent room, and the long, rangy, echoing
metal book-stacks, and the duddy-looking portraits,
and the dopy-acting busts, and the sleek gray library
cat&mdash;and the girl. Maybe Sagner came every
Wednesday night to help close the library.</p>

<p>Certainly I liked the frank, almost boyish manner
in which the two friends included me in their
friendship by seeming to ignore me altogether.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bertus?" the girl began
quite abruptly. "You look worried. What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is ever the matter," said Sagner.</p>

<p>The girl laughed, and began to build a high, tottering
paper tower out of a learned-looking pack of
catalogue cards. Just at the moment of completion
she gave a sharp little inadvertent sigh and the
tower fluttered down.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with <i>you?</i>" quizzed Sagner.</p>

<p>"Nothing is ever the matter with me, either," she
mocked smilingly.</p>

<p>Trying to butt into the silence that was awkward
for me, if not for them, I rummaged my brain for
speech, and blurted out triumphantly, "We've just
come from Professor Lennart's."</p>

<p>"Just come from Professor Lennart's?" she repeated
slowly, lifting her eyebrows as though the
thought was a little bit heavy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Sagner bluntly. "I've been there
twice this evening."</p>

<p>With a rather playful twist of her lips the girl
turned to me. "What did you think of 'Little Sister'?"
she asked.</p>

<p>But before I could answer, Sagner had pushed
me utterly aside once more and was shaking his
smoke-stained finger threateningly in Madge Hubert's
face. "Why&mdash;didn't&mdash;you&mdash;come&mdash;to
the&mdash;Lennarts'&mdash;to&mdash;dinner&mdash;to-night&mdash;as&mdash;you&mdash;were&mdash;invited?"
he scolded.</p>

<p>The girl put her chin in her hand and cuddled her
fingers over her mouth and her nose and part of
her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't go to the Lennarts' any more&mdash;if I can
help it," she mumbled.</p>

<p>"Why not?" shouted Sagner.</p>

<p>She considered the question very carefully, then
"Go ask the other girls," she answered a trifle
hotly. "Go ask any one of them. We all stay
away for exactly the same reason."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">What is the reason?</span>" thundered Sagner in
his most terrible laboratory manner.</p>

<p>When Sagner speaks like that to me, I always
grab hold of my head with both hands and answer
just as fast as I possibly can, for I remember only
too distinctly all the shining assortment of different
sized knives and scalpels in his workshop and I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
always found that a small, narrow, quick question
makes the smallest, narrowest, quickest, soon-overest
incision into my secret.</p>

<p>But Madge Hubert only laughed at the laboratory
manner.</p>

<p>"Say 'Please,'" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Please!" growled Sagner, with his very own
blood flushing all over his face and hands.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;what is it you want to know?" she
asked, frittering her fingers all the time over that
inky-looking pack of catalogue cards.</p>

<p>Somehow, strange as it may seem, I did not feel
an atom in the way, but rather that the presence
of a third person, and that person myself, gave
them both a certain daring bravado of speech that
they would scarcely have risked alone with each
other.</p>

<p>"What do I want to know?" queried Sagner.
"I want to know&mdash;in fact&mdash;I'm utterly mad to
know&mdash;just what your kind of woman thinks of
'Little Sister's' kind of woman."</p>

<p>With a startled gesture Madge Hubert looked back
over her shoulder toward a creak in the literature
book-stack, and Sagner jumped up with a great air
of mock conspiracy, and went tip-toeing all around
among the metal corridors in search of possible
eavesdroppers, and then came flouncing back and
stuffed tickly tissue paper into the gray cat's ears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Then "Why don't you girls go to the Lennarts'
any more?" he resumed with quickly recurrent
gravity.</p>

<p>For a moment Madge Hubert dallied to shuffle
one half of her pack of cards into the other half.
Then she looked up and smiled the blond way a
white-birch tree smiles in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;we don't go any more because we don't
have a good time," she confided. "After you've
come home from a party once or twice and cried
yourself to sleep, it begins to dawn on you very
gradually that you didn't have a very good time.
We don't like 'Little Sister.' She makes us feel
ashamed."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Sagner, rather brutally. "You are
all jealous!"</p>

<p>But if he had expected for a second to disconcert
Madge Hubert he was most ingloriously mistaken.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered perfectly simply. "We
are all jealous."</p>

<p>"Of her beauty?" scowled Sagner.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Madge Hubert. "Of her innocence."</p>

<p>Acid couldn't have eaten the fiber out of Madge
Hubert's emotional honesty. "Why, yes," she
hurried on vehemently, "among all the professors'
daughters here in town there isn't one of us who is
innocent enough to do happily even once the things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
that 'Little Sister' does every day of her life.
You are quite right. We are all furiously jealous."</p>

<p>With sudden professional earnestness she ran her
fingers through the catalogue cards and picked out
one and slapped it down in front of Sagner.
"There!" she said. "That's the book that explains
all about it. It says that jealousy is an emotion
that is aroused only by business competition,
which accounts, of course, for the fact that, socially
speaking, you very rarely find any personal enmity
between men. There are so many, many different
kinds of businesses for men, that interests very
seldom conflict&mdash;so that the broker resents <i>only</i>
the broker, and the minister resents <i>only</i> the minister,
and the merchant resents <i>only</i> the merchant.
Why, Bertus Sagner," she broke off abruptly, "you
fairly idolize your chemistry friend here, and Lennart
for history, and Dudley for mathematics, and
all the others, and you glory in their achievements,
and pray for their successes. But if there were
another biology man here in town, you'd tear him
and his methods tooth and nail, day and night.
Yes, you would!&mdash;though you'd cover your hate
a foot deep with superficial courtesies and 'professional
etiquette.'"</p>

<p>She began to laugh. "Oh, the book is very
wise," she continued more lightly. "It goes on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
say that woman's only business in the whole
wide world is <span class="smcap">love</span>&mdash;that Love is really the one
and only, the Universal Profession for Women&mdash;so
that every mortal feminine creature, from the
brownest gypsy to the whitest queen, is in brutal,
acute competition with her neighbor. It's funny,
isn't it!" she finished brightly.</p>

<p>"Very funny," growled Sagner.</p>

<p>"So you see," she persisted, "that we girls are
jealous of 'Little Sister' in just about the same
way in which an old-fashioned, rather conservative
department store would be jealous of the first ten-cent
store that came to town." A sudden rather
fine white pride paled suddenly in her cheeks. "It
isn't, you understand," she said, "it isn't because
the ten-cent store's rhinestone comb, or
tinsel ribbon, or slightly handled collar really
competes with the other store's plainer but possibly
honester values, but&mdash;because in the long run
the public's frittered taste and frittered small
change is absolutely bound to affect the general receipts
of the more conservative store."</p>

<p>"And it isn't," she added hastily, "it isn't,
you know, because we're not used to men. There
isn't one of us&mdash;from the time we were sixteen
years old&mdash;who hasn't been quite accustomed
to entertain anywhere from three to a
dozen men every evening of her life. But we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
can't entertain them the way 'Little Sister' does."
A hot, red wave of mortification flooded her face.
"We tried it once," she confessed, "and it didn't
work. Just before the last winter party seven of
us girls got together and deliberately made up our
minds to beat 'Little Sister' at her own game.
Wasn't it disgusting of us to start out actually and
deliberately with the intention of being just a little
wee bit free and easy with men?"</p>

<p>"How did it work?" persisted Sagner, half agrin.</p>

<p>The color flushed redder and redder into Madge
Hubert's cheeks.</p>

<p>"I went to the party with the new psychology
substitute," she continued bravely, "and as I stepped
into the carriage I called him 'Fred'&mdash;and he
looked as though he thought I was demented. But
fifteen minutes afterward I heard 'Little Sister'
call him 'Psyche'&mdash;and he laughed." She began
to laugh herself.</p>

<p>"But how did the party come out?" probed Sagner,
going deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>The girl sobered instantly. "There were seven
of us," she said, "and we all were to meet at the
house of one of the girls at twelve o'clock and compare
experiences. Three of us came home at ten
o'clock&mdash;crying. And four of us didn't turn up
till half-past one&mdash;laughing. But the ones who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
came home crying were the only ones who really
had any fun out of it. The game was altogether
too easy&mdash;that was the trouble with it. But the
four who came home laughing had been bored to
death with their <i>un</i>-successes."</p>

<p>"Which lot were you in?" cried Sagner.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I won't tell you," she
whispered.</p>

<p>With almost startling pluck she jumped up suddenly
and switched the electric light full blast into
her tense young face and across her resolute shoulders.</p>

<p>"Look at me!" she cried. "Look at me! As
long as men are men&mdash;what have I that can possibly,
possibly compete with a girl like 'Little Sister'?
Can I climb up into a man's face every time
I want to speak to him? Can I pat a man's shoulder
every time he passes me in a room? Can I
hold out my quivering white hand and act perfectly
helpless in a man's presence every time that I want
to step into a carriage, or out of a chair? Can I
cry and grieve and mope into a man's arms at a
dance just because I happen to cut my finger on
the sharp edge of my dance-order? Bah! If a
new man came to town and made not one single
man-friend but called all of us girls by our first
names the second time he saw us, and rolled his
eyes at us, and fluttered his hands, you people would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
call him the biggest fool in Christendom&mdash;but you
flock by the dozens and the hundreds and the millions
every evening to see 'Little Sister.' And
great, grown-up, middle-aged boys like <i>you</i>, Bertus
Sagner, flock <i>twice</i> in the same evening!"</p>

<p>With astounding irrelevance Sagner burst out
laughing. "Why, Madge," he cried, "you're perfectly
superb when you're mad. Keep it up.
Keep it up. I didn't know you had it in you!
Why, you dear, gorgeous girl&mdash;<span class="smcap">why aren't you
married</span>?"</p>

<p>Like a scarlet lightning-bolt spiked with two-edged
knives the red wrath of the girl descended
then and there on Sagner's ugly head.
With her heaving young shoulders braced like a
frenzied creature at bay, against a great, silly,
towering tier of "Latest Novels," she hurled her
flaming, irrevocable answer crash-bang into Sagner's
astonished, impertinent face.</p>

<p>"You want to know why I'm not married?"
she cried. "You want to know why I'm not married?
Well, I'll tell you&mdash;why&mdash;I'm&mdash;not
married, Bertus Sagner, and I'll use yourself for an
illustration&mdash;for when I do come to marry, it is
written in the stars that I must of necessity marry
your kind, a mature, cool, calculating, emotionally-tamed
man, a man of brain as well as brawn, a
man of fame if not of fortune, a man bred intellectually,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
morally, socially, into the same wonderfully
keen, thinky corner of the world where I was
born&mdash;nothing but a woman.</p>

<p>"For four years, Bertus Sagner, ever since I
was nineteen years old, people have come stumbling
over each other at college receptions to stare at me
because I am 'the girl that Bertus Sagner, the big
biologist, is <i>almost</i> in love with.' And you <i>are</i>
'almost' in love with me, Bertus Sagner. You
can't deny it! And what is more, you will stay
'almost' in love with me till our pulses run down
like clocks, and our eyes burn out like lamps, and
the Real Night comes. If I remain here in this
town, even when I am middle-aged&mdash;people will
come and stare at me&mdash;because of you. And
when I am old, and you are gone&mdash;altogether,
people will still be talking about it. 'Almost in
love' with me. Yes, Bertus Sagner, but if next
time you came to see me, I should even so much as
dally for a second on the arm of your chair, and
slip my hand just a little bit tremulously into yours,
and brush my lips like the ghost of a butterfly's
wing across your love-starved face, you would
probably find out then and there in one great, blinding,
tingling, crunching flash that you <span class="smcap">love me
now</span>! But I don't want <i>you</i>, Bertus Sagner, nor
any other man, at that price. The man who
was made for me will love me first and get his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
petting afterward. There! Do you understand
now?"</p>

<p>As though Sagner's gasp for breath was no more
than the flutter of a book-leaf, she plunged on,
"And as for Mrs. Lennart&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sagner jumped to his feet. "We weren't talking
about Mrs. Lennart," he exclaimed hotly.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that very few things
in the world are as quick as a woman's anger. But
nothing in the world, I am perfectly positive, is
as quick as a woman's amusement. As though an
anarchist's bomb had exploded into confetti, Madge
Hubert's sudden laughter sparkled through the
room.</p>

<p>"Now, Bertus Sagner," she teased, "you just
sit down again and listen to what I have to say."</p>

<p>Sagner sat down.</p>

<p>And as casually as though she were going to pour
afternoon tea the girl slipped back into her own
chair, and gave me a genuinely mirthful side-glance
before she resumed her attack on Sagner.</p>

<p>"You were, too, talking about Mrs. Lennart,"
she insisted. "When you asked me to tell you
exactly what a girl of my kind thinks of a girl like
'Little Sister,' do you suppose for a second I didn't
understand that the thing you really wanted to find
out was whether Mrs. Lennart was getting hurt
or not in this 'Little Sister' business? Oh, no,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Mrs. Lennart hasn't been hurt for a long, long
time&mdash;several months perhaps. I think she looks
a little bit bored now and then, but not hurt."</p>

<p>"Lennart's a splendid fellow," protested Sagner.</p>

<p>"He's a splendid fool," said Madge Hubert.
"And after a woman once discovers that her husband
is a fool I don't suppose that any extra illustrations
on his part make any particular difference
to her."</p>

<p>"Why, you don't&mdash;really think," stammered
Sagner, "that there's any actual harm in Lennart's
perfectly frank infatuation with 'Little Sister'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Madge Hubert, "of course there's
no real harm in it at all. It's only that Mrs. Lennart
has got to realize once for all that the special
public that she has catered to so long and faithfully
with honest values and small profit, has really got
a ten-cent taste! Most men have. And it isn't,
you know, because Professor Lennart really wants
or needs all these ten-cent toys and favors, but because
he probably never before in all his studious,
straight, idealistic life saw glittering nonsense so
inordinately cheap and easy to get. Talk about
women being 'bargain-hunters'!</p>

<p>"But, of course, it's all pretty apt to ruin Mrs.
Lennart's business. Anybody with half a heart
could see that her stock is beginning to run down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
She hasn't put in a new idea for months. She's
wearing last year's clothes. She's thinking last
year's thoughts. Even that blessed smile of hers
is beginning to get just a little bit stale. You can't
get what you want from her any more. Dust and
indifference have already begun to set in. How
will it end? Oh, I'll tell you how it will end.
Pretty soon now college will be over and the men
will scatter in five hundred different directions, and
'Little Sister' will be smitten suddenly with conscientious
scruples about the 'old folks at home,'
and will pack up her ruffles and her fraternity pins
and go back to the provincial little town that has
made her what she is. And Professor Lennart will
mope around the house like a lost soul&mdash;for as
much as five days&mdash;moaning, 'Oh, I wish "Little
Sister" was here to-night to sing to me,' and 'I
wish "Little Sister" was going to be here to-morrow
to go canoeing with me,' and 'I wish "Little
Sister" could see this moonlight,' and 'I wish "Little
Sister" could taste this wild-strawberry pie.'
And then somewhere about the sixth day, when he
and Mrs. Lennart are at breakfast or dinner or
supper, he'll look up suddenly like a man just freed
from a delirium, and drop his cup, or his knife, or
his fork 'ker-smash' into his plate, and cry out,
'My Heavens, Mary! But it's pretty good just for
<i>you</i> and <i>me</i> to be alone together again!'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what will Mrs. Lennart say?" interposed
Sagner hastily, with a great puff of smoke.</p>

<p>For some unaccountable reason Madge Hubert's
eyes slopped right over with tears.</p>

<p>"What will Mary Lennart say?" she repeated.
"Mary Lennart will say: 'Excuse me, dear, but
I wasn't listening. I didn't hear what you said.
I was trying to remember whether or not I'd put
moth-balls in your winter suit.' Though he live to
be nine hundred and sixty-two, Harold Lennart's
love-life will never rhyme again. But prose, of
course, is a great deal easier to live than verse."</p>

<p>As though we had all been discussing the latest
foreign theory concerning microbes, Sagner jumped
up abruptly and began to rummage furiously
through a pile of German bulletins. When he had
found and read aloud enough things that he didn't
want, he looked up and said nonchalantly, "Let's
go home."</p>

<p>"All right," said Madge Hubert.</p>

<p>"Maybe you hadn't noticed that I was here," I
suggested, "but I think that perhaps I should like
to go home, too."</p>

<p>As we banged the big, oaken, iron-clamped door
behind us, Madge Hubert lingered a second and
turned her white face up to the waning, yellow
moonlight. "I think I'd like to go home through
the dark woods," she decided.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Silently we all turned down into the soft, padded
path that ran along the piny shore of our little
college lake. Sagner of course led the way.
Madge Hubert followed close. And I tagged along
behind as merrily as I could. Twice I saw the girl's
shoulders shudder.</p>

<p>"Don't you like the woods, Miss Hubert?" I
called out experimentally.</p>

<p>She stopped at once and waited for me to catch
up with her. There was the very faintest possible
suggestion of timidity in the action.</p>

<p>"Don't you like the woods?" I repeated.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, not especially," she
answered. "That is, not all woods. There's such
a difference. Some woods feel as though they had
violets in them, and some woods feel as though they
had&mdash;Indians."</p>

<p>I couldn't help laughing. "How about these
woods?" I quizzed.</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp. "I don't believe there
are violets in any woods to-night," she faltered.</p>

<p>Even as she spoke we heard a swish and a crackle
ahead of us and Sagner came running back.
"Let's go round the other way," he insisted.</p>

<p>"I won't go round the other way," said Madge
Hubert. "How perfectly absurd! What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>Even as she argued we stepped out into the open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
clearing and met Harold Lennart and "Little Sister"
singing their way home hand in hand through
the witching night. For an instant our jovial greetings
parried together, and then we passed. Not till
we had reached Madge Hubert's doorstep did I
lose utterly the wonderful lilting echo of that
young contralto voice with the man's older tenor
ringing in and out of it like a shimmery silver
lining.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later in Sagner's cluttered workroom
we two men sat and stared through our pipe-smoke
into each other's evasive eyes.</p>

<p>"Madge didn't&mdash;hesitate at all&mdash;to tell me
a thing or two to-night, did she?" Sagner began
at last, gruffly.</p>

<p>I smiled. The relaxation made me feel as though
my mouth had really got a chance at last to sit
down.</p>

<p>"Am I so very old?" persisted Sagner. "I'm
not forty-five."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>Pettishly he reached out and clutched at a scalpel,
cleansed it for an instant in the flame, and
jabbed the point of it into his wrist. The red blood
spurted instantly.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried out triumphantly. "I have
blood in me! It isn't embalming fluid at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, quit your fooling, you old death-digger," I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
said. And then with overtense impulse I asked,
"Sagner, man, do you really understand Life?"</p>

<p>Sagner's jaw-bones stiffened instantly. "Oh,
yes," he exclaimed. "Oh, yes, of course I understand
Life. That is," he added, with a most unusual
burst of humility, "I understand everything,
I think, except just why the gills of a fish&mdash;but,
oh, bother, you wouldn't know what I meant; and
there's a new French theory about odylic forces
that puzzles me a little, and I never, never have
been able to understand the particular mental
processes of a woman who violates the law of
species by naming her firstborn son for any man
but his father. I'm not exactly criticising the fish,"
he added vehemently, "nor the new odylic theory,
nor even the woman; I'm simply stating baldly and
plainly the only three things under God's heaven
that I can't quite seem to fathom."</p>

<p>"What's all this got to do with Mary Lennart?"
I asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all to do with Mary Lennart," he
answered proudly. "Mary Lennart's son is named
Harold." He began to smoke very hard. "Considering
the real object of our being put here in the
world," he resumed didactically, "it has always
seemed to me that the supreme test of character lay
in the father's and mother's mental attitude toward
their young."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>"Couldn't you say 'toward their children'?" I
protested.</p>

<p>He brushed my interruption aside. "I don't
care," he persisted, "how much a man loves a
woman or how much a woman loves a man&mdash;the
man who deserts his wife during her crucial hour
and goes off on a lark to get out of the fuss, and
the woman who names her firstborn son for any
man except his father, may qualify in all the available
moral tenets, but they certainly have slipped
up somehow, mentally, in the Real Meaning of
things. Thank God," he finished quickly, "that
neither Harold Lennart nor Mary has failed the
other like that&mdash;no matter what else happens."
His face whitened. "I stayed with Harold Lennart
the night little Harold was born," he whispered
rather softly.</p>

<p>Before I could think of just the right thing to
say, he jumped up awkwardly and strode over to
the looking-glass, and puffed out his great chest
and stood and stared at himself.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a son named Bertus Sagner," he
said.</p>

<p>"It's all right, of course, to have him named
after you," I laughed, "but you surely wouldn't
choose to have him look like you, would you?"</p>

<p>He turned on me with absurd fierceness. "I
wouldn't marry any woman who didn't love me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
enough to want her son to look like me!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I was still laughing as I picked up my hat. I
was still laughing as I stumbled and fumbled down
the long, black, steep stairs. Half an hour later in
my pillows I was still laughing. But I did not get
to sleep. My mind was too messy. After all,
when you really come to think of it, a man's brain
ought to be made up fresh and clean every night
like a hotel bed. Sleep seems to be altogether too
dainty a thing to nest in any brain that strange
thoughts have rumpled. Always there must be the
white sheet of peace edging the blanket of forgetfulness.
And perhaps on one or two of life's
wintrier nights some sort of spiritual comforter
thrown over all.</p>

<p>It was almost a week before I saw any of the
Lennarts again. Then, on a Saturday afternoon,
as Sagner and I were lolling along the road toward
town we met Lennart and "Little Sister" togged
out in a lot of gorgeous golf duds. Lennart was
delighted to see us, and "Little Sister" made Sagner
get down on his knees and tie her shoe lacings
twice. I escaped with the milder favor of a pat on
the wrist.</p>

<p>"We're going out to the Golf Club," beamed
Lennart, "to enter for the tournament."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sagner, turning to join them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
"Shall we find Mrs. Lennart out at the club? Is
she going to play?"</p>

<p>A flicker of annoyance went over Lennart's face.
"Why, Sagner," he said, "how stupid you are!
Don't you know that Mary is lame and couldn't
walk over the golf course now to save her life?"</p>

<p>As Sagner turned back to me, and we passed on
out of hearing, I noted two red spots flaming hectically
in his cheeks.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," he muttered, "that if I had
crippled or incapacitated my wife in any way so
that she couldn't play golf any more, I wouldn't
exactly take another woman into the tournament.
I think that singles would just about fit me under
the circumstances."</p>

<p>"But Lennart is such a 'splendid fellow,'" I
quoted wryly.</p>

<p>"He's a splendid fool," snapped Sagner.</p>

<p>"Why, you darned old copy-cat," I taunted.
"It was Miss Hubert who rated him as a 'splendid
fool.'"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sagner.</p>

<p>"Oh, yourself," said I.</p>

<p>Involuntarily we turned and watched the two
bright figures skirting the field. Almost at that
instant they stopped, and the girl reached up with
all her clinging, cloying coquetry and fastened a
great, pink wild rose into the lapel of the man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
coat. Sagner groaned. "Why can't she keep her
hands off that man?" he muttered; then he
shrugged his shoulders with a grim little gesture of
helplessness. "If a girl doesn't know," he said,
"that it's wrong to chase another woman's man
she's too ignorant to be congenial. If she does
know it's wrong, she's too&mdash;vicious. But never
mind," he finished abruptly, "Lennart's foolishness
will soon pass. And meanwhile Mary has her boy.
Surely no lad was ever so passionately devoted to
his mother. They are absolutely inseparable. I
never saw anything like it." He began to smile
again.</p>

<p>Then, because at a turn of the road he saw a
bird that reminded him of a beast that reminded
him of a reptile, he left me unceremoniously and
went back to the laboratory.</p>

<p>Feeling a bit raw over his desertion, I gave up
my walk and decided to spend the rest of the afternoon
at the library.</p>

<p>At the edge of the reading-room I found Madge
Hubert brandishing a ferocious-looking paper-knife
over the perfectly helpless new magazines. With
a little cry of delight she summoned me to her by
the wave of a <i>Science Monthly</i>. Looking over her
shoulder I beheld with equal delight that the canny
old Science paper had stuck in Sagner's great, ugly
face for a frontispiece. At arm's length, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
opening and narrowing eyes, I studied the perfect,
clever likeness: the convict-cropped hair; the surly,
aggressive, relentlessly busy features; the absurd,
overwrought, deep-sea sort of eyes. "Great
Heavens, Miss Hubert," I said, "did you ever see
such a funny-looking man?"</p>

<p>The girl winced. "Funny?" she gasped.
"Funny? Why, I think Bertus Sagner is the most
absolutely fascinating-looking man that I ever saw
in my life." She stared at me in astonishment.</p>

<p>To hide my emotions I fled to the history room.
Somewhat to my surprise Mrs. Lennart and her
little lad were there, delving deep into some thrilling
grammar-school problem concerning Henry the
Eighth. I nodded to them, thought they saw me,
and slipped into a chair not far behind them. There
was no one else in the room. Maybe my thirst for
historical information was not very keen. Certainly
every book that I touched rustled like a dead,
stale autumn leaf. Maybe the yellow bird in the
acacia tree just outside the window teased me a little
bit. Anyway, my eyes began only too soon to
stray from the text-books before me to the little
fluttering wisp of Mrs. Lennart's hair that tickled
now and then across the lad's hovering face. I
thought I had never seen a sweeter picture than
those two cuddling, browsing faces. Surely I had
never seen one more entrancingly serene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/gs09.jpg" width="312" height="500" alt="&quot;Oh, I wish I had a sister,&quot; fretted the boy" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Oh, I wish I had a sister,&quot; fretted the boy</span>
</div>

<p>Then suddenly I saw the lad push back his books
with a whimper of discontent.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked his mother. I could hear
her words plainly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I had a sister," fretted the boy.</p>

<p>"Why?" said the mother in perfectly happy surprise.</p>

<p>The lad began to drum on the table. "Why do
I want a sister?" he repeated a trifle temperishly.
"Why, so I could have some one to play with and
walk with and talk with and study with. Some one
jolly and merry and frisky."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what about <i>me?</i>" she quizzed. Even
at that moment I felt reasonably certain that she
was still smiling.</p>

<p>The little lad looked bluntly up into her face.
"Why you are&mdash;<i>so old!</i>" he said quite distinctly.</p>

<p>I saw the woman's shoulders hunch as though
her hands were bracing against the table. Then
she reached out like a flash and clutched the little
lad's chin in her fingers. If a voice-tone has any
color, hers was corpse-white. "I never&mdash;let&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;know&mdash;that&mdash;you&mdash;were&mdash;too&mdash;<i>young!</i>"
she almost hissed.</p>

<p>And I shut my eyes.</p>

<p>When I looked up again the woman was gone,
and the little lad was running after her with a
queer, puzzled look on his face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Life has such a strange way of foreshortening
its longest plots with a startling, snapped-off ending.
Any true story is a tiny bit out of rhetorical
proportion.</p>

<p>The very next day, under the railroad trestle that
hurries us back and forth to the big, neighboring
city, we found Mrs. Lennart's body in a three-foot
pool of creek water. It was the little lad's birthday,
it seems, and he was to have had a supper
party, and she had gone to town in the early afternoon
to make a few festive purchases. A package
of tinsel-paper bonbons floated safely, I remember,
in the pool beside her. For some inexplainable
reason she had stepped off the train at the wrong
station and, realizing presumably how her blundering
tardiness would blight the little lad's pleasure,
she had started to walk home across the trestle,
hoping thereby to beat the later train by as much
as half an hour. The rest of the tragedy was
brutally plain. Somehow between one safe,
friendly embankment and another she had slipped
and fallen. The trestle was ticklish walking for
even a person who wasn't lame.</p>

<p>Like a slim, white, waxen altar candle snuffed
out by a child's accidental, gusty pleasure-laugh, we
brought her home to the sweet, green, peaceful library,
with its resolute, indomitable hearthstone.</p>

<p>Out of all the crowding people who jostled me in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the hallway I remember only&mdash;Lennart's ghastly,
agonized face.</p>

<p>"Go and tell Sagner," he said.</p>

<p>Even as I crossed the campus the little, fluttery,
flickery, hissing word "suicide" was in the air.
From the graduates' dormitory I heard a man's
voice argue, "But why did she get off deliberately
at the wrong station?" Out of the president's
kitchen a shrill tone cackled, "Well, she ain't been
herself, they say, for a good many weeks. And
who wonders?"</p>

<p>In one corner of the laboratory, close by an open
window, I found Sagner working, as I had expected,
in blissful ignorance.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>I was very awkward. I was very clumsy. I
was very frightened. My face was all condensed
like a telegram.</p>

<p>"Madge Hubert was right," I stammered.
"Mrs. Lennart's&mdash;business&mdash;has gone into the
hands of a&mdash;receiver."</p>

<p>The glass test tube went brittling out of Sagner's
fingers. "Do you mean that she is&mdash;dead?"
he asked.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>For the fraction of a moment he rolled back his
great, shaggy brows, and lifted his face up wide-eyed
and staring to the soft, sweet, dove-colored,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
early evening sky. Then his eyelids came scrunching
down again perfectly tight, and I saw one side
of his ugly mouth begin to smile a little as a man
might smile&mdash;as he closes the door&mdash;when the
woman whom he loves comes home again. Then
very slowly, very methodically, he turned off all
the gas-burners and picked up all the notebooks,
and cleansed all the knives, and just as I thought
he was almost ready to go with me he started back
again and released a fair, froth-green lunar moth
from a stifling glass jar. Then, with his arm across
my cringing shoulders, we fumbled our way down
the long, creaky stairs. And all the time his heart
was pounding like an oil-soused engine. But I had
to bend my head to hear the questions that crumbled
from his lips.</p>

<p>As we crunched our way across the Lennarts'
garden with all the horrible, rackety noise that the
living inevitably make in the presence of the dead,
we ran into Lennart's old gardener crouching there
in the dusk, stuffing cold, white roses into a huge
market basket. Almost brutally Sagner clutched
the old fellow by the arm. "Dunstan," he demanded,
"how&mdash;did&mdash;this&mdash;thing&mdash;happen?"</p>

<p>The old gardener shook with fear and palsy.
"There's some," he whispered, "as says the lady-dear
was out of her mind. A-h, no," he protested,
"a-h, no. She may ha' been out of her heart, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
she weren't never out of her mind. There's
some," he choked, "as calls it suicide, there's
some," he gulped, "as calls it accident. I'm a
rough-spoke man and I don' know the tongue o'
ladies, but it weren't suicide, and it weren't accident.
If it had be'n a man that had done it, you'd
'a' called it just a 'didn't-give-a-damn.'"</p>

<p>As we neared the house Sagner spoke only once.
"Barney," he asked quite cheerfully, "were you
ever rude to a woman?"</p>

<p>My hands went instinctively up to my head.
"Oh, yes," I hurried, "once in the Arizona desert
I struck an Indian squaw."</p>

<p>"Does it hurt?" persisted Sagner.</p>

<p>"You mean 'Did it hurt?'" I answered a bit
impatiently. "Yes, I think it hurt her a little, but
not nearly as much as she deserved."</p>

<p>Sagner reached forward and yanked me back
by the shoulder. "I mean," he growled, "do you
remember it now in the middle of the night, and
are you sorry you did it?"</p>

<p>My heart cramped. "Yes," I acknowledged,
"I remember it now in the middle of the night.
But I am distinctly not sorry that I did it."</p>

<p>"Oh," muttered Sagner.</p>

<p>With the first creaking sound of our steps in the
front hall "Little Sister" came gliding down the
stairway with the stark-faced laddie clutching close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
at her sash. All the sparkle and spangle were gone
from the girl. Her eyes were like two bruises on
the flesh of a calla lily. Slipping one ice-cold
tremulous hand into mine she closed down her other
frightened hand over the two. "I'm so very glad
you've come," she whispered huskily. "Mr. Lennart
isn't any comfort to me at all to-night&mdash;and
Mary was the only sister I had." Her voice caught
suddenly with a rasping sob. "You and Mr. Sagner
have always been so kind to me," she plunged
on blindly, with soft-drooping eyelids, "and I shall
probably never see either of you again. We are all
going home to-morrow. And I expect to be married
in July to a boy at home." Her icy fingers
quickened in mine like the bloom-burst of a sun-scorched
Jacqueminot.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;expect&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;married&mdash;in&mdash;July
to&mdash;a&mdash;boy&mdash;at&mdash;home?" cried Sagner.</p>

<p>The awful slicing quality in his voice brought
Lennart's dreadful face peering out through a slit
in the library curtains.</p>

<p>"Hush!" I signaled warningly to Sagner. But
again his venomous question ripped through the
quiet of the house.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;expected&mdash;all&mdash;the&mdash;time&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;married&mdash;in&mdash;July?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the girl, with the faintest dimpling
flicker of a smile. "Won't you congratulate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
me?" Very softly she drew her right hand away
from me and held it out whitely to Sagner.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Sagner, "but I have just&mdash;washed&mdash;my&mdash;hands."</p>

<p>"What?" stammered the girl. "W-h-a-t?"</p>

<p>"Excuse&mdash;me," said Sagner, "but I have just&mdash;washed
my hands."</p>

<p>Then, bowing very, very low, like a small boy at
his first dancing-school, Sagner passed from the
house.</p>

<p>When I finally succeeded in steering my shaking
knees and flopping feet down the long front steps
and the pleasant, rose-bordered path, I found Sagner
waiting for me at the gateway. Under the
basking warmth of that mild May night his teeth
were chattering as with an ague, and his ravenous
face was like the face of a man whose soul is utterly
glutted, but whose body has never even so
much as tasted food and drink.</p>

<p>I put both my hands on his shoulders. "Sagner,"
I begged, "if there is anything under God's
heaven that you want to-night&mdash;go and get it!"</p>

<p>He gave a short, gaspy laugh and wrenched himself
free from me. "There is nothing <i>under</i>
God's heaven&mdash;to-night&mdash;that I want&mdash;except
Madge Hubert," he said.</p>

<p>In another instant he was gone. With a wh-i-r
and a wh-i-s-h and a snow-white fragrance, his trail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
cut abruptly through the apple-bush hedge. Then
like a huge, black, sweet-scented sponge the darkening
night seemed to swoop down and wipe him right
off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Very softly I knelt and pressed my ear to the
ground. Across the young, tremulous, vibrant
greensward I heard the throb-throb-throb of a
man's feet&mdash;<i>running</i>.</p>
